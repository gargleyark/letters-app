We lost Barres (I think thats how you spell it) at the ferry, as he just got on one and we were left outside, so I havent seen him since.\nI’ll tell you all the rest in my next letter as we’ve got to turn in shortly.

      "letter":"14232057 Pte B Shepherd\n42 Platoon \n5 Company\n12 PTC\nNewport\nIsle of Wight\n\nDear Kath,\nPlease forgive me if this letter is a bit out of form, only I feel just about all in. We had our inoculations this afternoon (Saturday) and do we feel good? I should say so. Sore arms, thick head, a flaming headacke and generaly rotten. We’ve got 48 hrs rest thankgoodness (the first 5 mins off since we came down) so we don’t start again till Monday, although we are not allowed out of barracks until next week.\nWell Kath if the weather up there is anything like the weather here, it doesn’t look too promising for your holiday. It been raining here half the blue Pencil time and I’m just beginning to wonder if the sun ever does shine down here! Anyway, I do hope you have a nice time, I shall be thinking of you just the same I have this week. I expect you’ll recieve another letter from me before you go, although our postage is geld up a lot because of the cencor. I Hope you was not dissapointed at not having a letter on saturday but I’m afraid I can’t help that.\nI don’t know whether you heard on the radio a talk about our corps, I hope you did. Well in it he said that the training lasted only six weeks, well thats quite right, I shall only be here 6 weeks so I may be able to get home when we move. But please don’t take this for granted as we may get shifted straight off to somewhere else without any leave, so let us hope for the Best and Look for the worst.I’ve got a decent lot of chaps here with me so don’t worry about me, I’m OK except that I’m doing more work now than I’ve ever done in my life, and we only get 5 cigarettes a day, and we also get up too early in the morning. I’m very surprised at the food though, as we get as much as we can eat and its pretty good although its a bit rough as you can guess.\nTheese boots they have dished us out have given me a present on the back of my heals but I expect I’ll get used to them in time (I bet your laughing). I’ve never worn a pair of boots in my life, and you can take it from me they feel damn funny. (I should love to see you with them on)\nI was very disappointed on thursday as I never met that girl that you read about in the paper, who I was suposed to meet. Very disappointed indeed! (Please excuse me of any mistakes, only I’m writing, listening and talking all at once (or trying to))\nI don’t know how the war is going on; down here theres no papers or wireless so it might be over for all I know, I expect we’ll get some papers when we are allowed out.\nI’ve just been reading through this letter and I find I must be drunk (I havent touched a drop of beer since I came down so it must be love). On the other side of the first sheet I put that I’d be able to send another letter before you went to Canvey but I forgot you wont recieve this till about wednesday. Also although I put that we only get 5 cigarettes a day I’m not hinting - DON’T send me any down here as I’m going to cut them down, and if you send me any I shall only smoke them!\nDon’t forget to go and see my mother sometimes will you, only she would love a bit of company now and a gain as Dad & I are away for a while.\nGive my love to all of you at Sunnyside, hoping your all find.\nI’m sorry I’ve got to say Cheerio Kath but I’ve got one or two things to do before lights out, so keep smiling and hope for the best.\nGoodnight darling\nYours\nBern\n"

      "letter":"14232057 Pte B Shepherd\n42 Platoon \n5 Company\n12 PTC\nNewport\nIsle o Wight\n\nDearest Kath,\nThanks very much for the two letters I recieved today, one this morning and one this afternoon. Now that I’m getting a bit used to army life I can give you a few more details. I must admit I rather like this new life now, or rather I would if Ilford was only just round the corner of if this way of life only lasted about 3 to 6 months. Of cause its rather hard at the present and will get harder as we get used to it but I don’t mind that as it will toughen me up a bit. We’ve done a bit of foot sloging, and what with a lovely blister on each heel and a rifle digging in your shoulder it ain’t good at times. Luckily we’ve got good NCOs and sargent in our lot and I pity the other poor blighters who have not. The only chaps I don’t like are those taking us for P.T., you know the \"hearts of iron\" sort of chaps! They certainly put us through it this afternoon.\nWe’ve had Rifle drill and cleaning although we have not yet been on the range also we’ve [censored] the country is quite nice out here so we don’t mind going out for theese lectures and demonstrations. Ofcourse the weather changing theese last two days has made things a lot better and I don’t think I’ve swetted so much in all my life before.\nIn all we have a pretty long day of it and thats what I object to as it makes the time drag so. We get up at 5.45 (the usual army time) and am going at it all day untill 6.30 or 7 with only a break for meals. Then of cause we have to do out cleaning, although so far been pretty sort of that owing to the shortage in the NAFFI canteen of cleaning material. One thing they don’t give you time to get home sick.\nI wrote to Pike yesterday as I though he may get his papers shortly so that he would know my address although I expect he would get it from you if it came to the push.\nI’m glad to hear your on better terms with Dad, hes a real brick when you get know him properly. It must have been that 10 stone that broke that train down! Its a good job you didn’t upset all that ink or you couldn’t have finished that letter.\nYour inquiry about ATS I’m afraid I have not seen any yet but I shan’t disappoint you, I’ll soon find some and I’ll let you know how we get on (up to a point). But joking apart, I have not seen more that two or three who have brought some vans down here.\nWell I’m afraid the bugle has gone to make our beds and in 10 mins they’ll be playing lights out so my pencil must have a rest and cool down.\nGive my love to your mother and Rene so good night, I write again as soon as I get time\nWith all my greatest Love,\nBern\nPS I hope this is OK I have not got time to read it through. bye bye\n"

      "letter":"14232057 Pte B SHEPHERD\n42 Platoon \n5 Company\n12 PTC\nNEWPORT ISLE of \nWIGHT\n\nDearest Kath,\nSo glad to received your other two letters; one last evening and the other this morning. It seems to bring you into the hut when I read them. I’m writing this letter during the afternoon, while most of the others have gone out to P.T. but I’m not there as, in another 5 minutes, I shall be going to the hospital for eye testing. The army supplies us with new glasses as the sides of our others push our gas mask out of shape.\nI see Kath that you’re asking about my uniform, well we’ve got it OK; we got it on the saturday after coming here but I wont say anything about it, just you wait and see for yourself! Thats more than I can do.\nHello Kath I’ve just picked up my pencil again after about 7 hours. I’ve just finished cleaning my gear and except for going to the NAFFI canteen about seven we have not had any time untill now. Its now 9.30. Beleave it or not after tea they made us start pulling up weeds in a spare peice of ground next to our hut. We said one or two words about that I can tell you.\nI’m very glad to hear you had a nice time at canvey darling the weather was certainly nice here anyway. I’m looking forward to the time when I can go down there with you.\nForget all about those cigarettes, I wish I had not told you, I’ll get out to the shops. We went out yesterday to newport as we knock off early on Wednesday at 5 o’clock, although we don’t get out before 6 or half Past as we must have some tea before we go. We went round to some inn and had a game darts then over to the Odeon. On such nights we don’t have to get in until 11 o’clock.\nPlease don’t start giving me a swelled head! Fancy! me a good letter writer, I nearly took it as a joke, and anyway whats wrong with yours. It makes me wonder how you find so much to say as I’ve got the camp to talk about but you’ve only got the same things as I was accustomed to a fortnight ago.\nIf I suddenly close this letter in a quick fashion its because of lights out which wont be many more minutes.\nToday we’ve had more rifle drill, Bren saluting, marching etc. you’d be surprised at the amount there is to learn in them.\nWell I’m sorry darling but I’m in the dark so Good night and sleep well\nWith Fondest Love\nBern\n"

      "letter":"14232057 Pte B Shepherd\n42 Platoon \n5 Company\n12 PTC\nNewport\nIsle of Wight\n\nDearest Kath,\nI must ask you to forgive me for not writing before, I feel such as beast for not writing as much as you do, especially as I realy had time on sunday. But as the rest of the gang was going out, and I must have a bit of a break at times, I went with them. We went rowing on the river in the afternoon (We was out on Church parade all the morning) then we dropped in a cafe in the evening and had some tea. Then had a game of darts in the usual.\nI should love to see that old cottage that you are staying at, it sounds very interesting. I don’t think I should like to live in a place like that for good but its just the thing of a holiday.\nIts a pity those fruit ain’t ripe yet, unless you’d make yourself sick with them as you did with the strawberrys. Anyway, you had a dose of stinging nettles instead! I laughed when I read about you eating a tame rabbit, anyway, you’ll like it.\nI hope you get on alright at First Aid. When I get home on leave don’t tie me up and forget how to undo it else I may say a few things that the army taught me.\nThe weather is not too good down here so I expect its the same as your place. It either looks like rain or it is raining.\nI hope to be able to get into an Ensa concert tonight held at the [censored] but as theres only a limited limited number allowed in there I don’t know whether I will be lucky enough to get in.\nI’ve recieved a letter from Bucks with an enclosed 5/-, it certainly is very nice of them all and I shall be writing them next time I get a chance. \nI hope everyone in the office is alright and the work is still as up to date as when I left. Ofcouse I understand that when the best man leaves it knocks thinks about abit but I expect, with the help of another half a dozen clerks they will get straight again.\nWe have not been doing any fresh here except when we went down to the range and had a bit of shooting with the rifle. I did not do to good - I couldn’t see the target properly.\nWell I’m afread I must close now as I want to write 3 more letters tonight, goodness knows how I’m going to do it.\nSo I must say goodnight now, and please forgive me for not writing before.\nCheerio,\nYours for ever\n\nx x x\nx x\nx x x x x x x x x x x x\nx x x x x x x x x\nx x x x x x x x x x x x\nx x x x x x x x\nx x x x x x x x x x x x\n"

      "letter":"14232057 Pte B Shepherd\n42 Platoon \n5 Company\n12 PTC\nNewport\nIsle of Wight\n\nDearest Kath,\nThanks so much for the letter written on Monday. Goodnes knows what I going to write about as we just do the same thing over and over again but I’ll just let me pencil flow and see what happens. Its our early night to night but I’m not going out with the rest of them so I’ve got plenty of time to write. I’m glad I’m not going out realy as it gives me a bit more time and makes you feel good when theres no rush as usual. I don’t know if you have not received all of my letters or whether you have not received them by the time you write yours but by the round of them it does not seem as though you have. Its a bit confusing as the letters are held up so much.\nI’ve received the five shillings from Bucks, its very good of them. It makes me feel as though I’m not cut off from the outer world so much as I thin. Its very surprising how cut off you feel when you’re out of the old country, stuck on an island. I can not express quite what I mean but I’ve got that same feeling all the time.\nI’m very sorry to hear that Ginty isn’t so good, I hope he comes through alright as he seemed a nice old dog and Rene would be very upset. Although I don’t know much about her, I think she would soon get over it (Rene I mean).\nI don’t know what you are going to do at work now Burden is doing the M.O.S. You had better find something to do or you may reach the 20 stone mark!\nYou upset me (can’t spell it) When you told me about Miss Pascoe leaving. I don’t know what Mr Warren will do with her and me both gone.\nI’m glad you’ve got over my going away, its more or less the same with me. After 3 or 4 day I settled down a bit better. At times when we are singing songs in the hut or someone says something that strikes a vital cord, my mind starts wandering back through the last 5 or 6 weeks. Such a lot has happened in that time, hasn’t it? I don’t know whether I would rather go back to those few days again or have it as it is. Anyway, we are nearer to the day when I shall see you again.\nOf all the cheek! Me playing soldiers! Why, I don’t even look like one, and when I play games theres no work attached to them.\nFancy you having the warning, I’d forgotten the war was still on down here until I read that. But still, you people will stop in the towns instead of going into the country like us.\nOld Warrens O.K., I expect you go to tea in pairs now but he knew you went out in any case, didn’t he?\nIts been very nice here today, although the wind has been very cold and we don’t have much on. Its a wonder we have not had colds but I expect it;s because we are in the open so much. I’m glad we were not called up at winter time anyway. One chap we were talking to said that when he first joined last winter, they had to clear the snow away before they could lay down for rifle drill. I expect poor old Burden will catch it as 10 to 1 he will be called up in January or something like that. I shall be getting used to it by then.\nYou can ask me as many questions as you like, I don’t mind. It puzzles me though what you want to ask, I expect its because I see the things every day I forget you don’t know anything about them. Heres a few I can think of anyway.\nI’ve got the uniforms, two of them but we work in our sort of overalls made something like our uniform from a cloth material. We sleep in beds, double deckers made something like the shelter bunks with wire across. We’ve got 3 blankets, a straw mattress and we use our kit bag as a billow. We have a NAFFI here, and they sell (sometimes) all our polishes and cleaning things beside the usual eats and drinks. I can’t think of any more but if you want to know any more just let me know darling.\nWell I will close my letter now dear and if I think of anything else to say while I’m cleaning I’ll put it on the end. So cheerio Kath, I hope you’re enjoying yourself now, I hwonder where you are at this moment 7.30 Wednesday evening.\nWell Cheerio again dearest, and look after your self, I’ll write again when I get time.\nWith all my fondest love,\nBern\n"

Nothing will happen here, I’ve got God to guard me, and you too Kath.\nThanks for going round to my mothers, its nice of you, although I can’t understand why your knees where knocking as shes nothing to be frightened off. That reminds me, I have not answered your other letter yet so I shall have to so it now. Do you know I don’t realy know what I have told you and what I havent as I tell someone something and get mixed up by the time I’ve written to 3 or 4 people.\nYou say Dennis is likely to be married shortly. I can imagine him being married alright alright in fact I think it suits him alot better than being single. Barbara Smith is coming back is she? What is she throwing her job up then?\nI’m jolly glad Ginty is alot better, I expect he will be alright in a week or two.\nI can have a good guess a to why they censored that in my letter. We were told about that sort of thing a couple of days ago. Its such a small thing you wouldn’t think it would matter but they do.\nSo Frank has got his papers has he? Anyway, he wanted them. I was going to write this afternoon but, as you say ‘Don’t’, I wont.\nAbout our clothes. We wear sort of overalls. They are the same shape (well, they are suposed to be) as the battle dress but are made with a cloth material. We only wear the trousers though as we work in our short sleeves.\nIts a pity your holiday was not this week, the weathers been just dandy for holidays as long as you don’t want to walk to far. (It has down here anyway.)\nThers really no news to tell you about this place except that I went to the M.O. about my foot as it developed into a big hole. So I’m on light duties (No marching) and I’ve to see him on Monday. It should be alright by then. They’ve put some bandage round it and it does not feel too bad. \nI’ve turned this page over only to find that its the last one on the pad but I’ll get some more at the naffi tonight, I hope.\nWe’ve got a chap in our room who is 6f. 8½ in height. He takes about one step to every two of anyone else. He can’t keep in step for love nor money.\nThey have had him on the square trying to make him do it but its impossible.\nWe had to go to the dentist yesterday. I had one filled and then the whole lot scraped. My teeth and gums still feel a bit rotten.\nYou will notice I’m sending this in a special envelope. We are issued with one of these each week and it should not take so long to reach you as it is not censored at this place. It may be censored in London and you get it in the neck if you put anything you shouldn’t. \n"

You ask what I brought down with me. Well theres one thing you must have in the army but I don’t know if they want them in the Navy, and thats a rag or dusters to clean equipment. Don’t forget handkerchiefs and he may also need a mirror, although we have some fixed in the wash house. He’d better take on in case. We have been provided with almost everything you need and I don’t think there is much else. I don’t know whether the Navy uses any blanco if so he will need a nail brush or something to put it on with. By the way he had better take a pair of siccors and a nail file. Tell him to take a length of string too.\nTell him theres not much in the inoculation, they just stick a needle in you and Bobs your uncle. You feel the effects in an hour or two but theres nothing in it. One chap fainted on Rifle drill this morning but I myself felt little of it.\nSo you’ve changed your mind about Summer by this time. The mud is wonderful round here and it will be a swamp here before long!\nThanks very much for the photo, its grand. I hope you didn’t have to line up long, anyway it was worth it. I think so anyway.\nI’m very very very sorry telling you about that 10 stone weight you carry about with you. I shall not do it again until the next time. But if you did start slimming I’ll give my unarmed combact a try out when I come home on leave.\nHow is the dog? Is he any better yet? You didn’t say anything in the letter so I don’t expect he isn’t any worse.\nI expect you have recieved the letter in a green envelope. I don’t know whether it got through any quicker but don’t take any notice of it by the date as I posted it on Sunday but it did not go out untill Monday. I also wrote to Burden the same day so you can find out if yours arrived much before his did.\nWe made up for the 48 hrs off today by doing two rifle drills and a nice country cross run, then to finish up we had to peel spuds (Potatoes) after we had finished out days work. We got back just 8.00. Ofcourse we’ve got some cleaning to do now, then the rest of the time is our own.\nWhat does Miss Sawyer say about Craze going to sea? I don’t think it will worry here much, will it, or have I got the wrong impression?\nYes, we do get every Sunday off and Saturday afternoons as well but the needles we’ve had have stopped us but we shall be able to go out more in the future. We get browned off stopping in the same place.\nI’m glad to hear that the camp snaps are O.K. I shall have to get once from Frank. He has promised me one anyway.\nHe did expect me to go to the last camp. In fact he was quite shocked when I said I wasn’t going and did all he could to make me go. In his last letter to me he said that if I wanted to, he would fix it up so that I could go when I am on leave. I think he wants me to have a change from army life. (Don’t for goodness sake tell him) When I am on leave darling I shall not want to be at Chigwell unless you’re there.\nI’m afraid I shall have to close now as I havent any more paper. I’ve been unable to buy a pad yet and this paper is borrowed so bye bye Kath give my love to all at No 59.\nYour Everlasting\nBern\nPS I’m very surprised to hear you have mended the radio as I didn’t know there was anything wrong\n"

I thought we would be able to get a bit more time to ourselves after we had been here a week or two but unfortunately the army thought different. Anyway, I must not make excuses as I could have written on Wednesday (our early night) but we went to the pictures and saw the ‘Day is Dawn’. I expect you’ve seen it. We get all the ‘latest’ pictures here.\nWell darling how have you been getting on this week? I see you have got a 2/6 rise. Its a pity I’m not still manager of the Dept as I would make it 5/- or else not give you any at all.\nI’ve got my new glasses and they’re rotten! Made of wire, and my nose is so sore where they dig in that I’ve got a good mind to put a bandage round it. They have given us two pairs incase we break one pair although they are pretty tough.\nMy feet are all O.K. now and so in my inoculation and teeth but the effects of the vaccination are only just starting as it take about a week to work. I’ve got a bit of pain under my arm and the sore is just beginning to develop.\nIt looks as though I’m going to have a beauty!\nIf you take my tip don’t join the ATS or anything. There will be a dickens of a row if you do.\nI’m sorry to hear the time is dragging so slow, I myself think it has gone quite quick. It usually does when you work hard.\nI’ve got some lousy news for you and its about my leave. I don’t think we are getting any leave when we leave here but I’m not sure mind you. I thought I’d tell you as a warning.\nThe weather has not been too good last few days, in fact I’ve been rather cold standing out in our shirt sleeves or with only footer shorts on. This is August, I hope its not always like this on the Isle of Wight.\nI don’t think mum is going to Wales next week as she has not said anything in her letters. Ofcourse mum wants to see you. What makes you think she doesn’t? So do I but if you don’t care about going round, say so.\nBye the way, I’m not writing on the other side of this paper as you can’t read it very well. Its a new pad I just got from the naffi.\nTheres one thing I meant to have asked you two or three times. Do they ever knock anything out of my letters? I think I keep away from those sort of things pretty well.\nTheres nothing much to say about what we are doing now. Its more or less revision of old stuff and a few more drills. We’ve been mucking about with Bayonets this week.\nWell I can’t think of any more darling so I’ll finish now and write a letter to mum if time permits. So bye bye Kath and I’ll write again soon. I’ll make a point of writing during the week end if it kills me. Goodnight\nYours\nBern\nP.S. I forgot something. Don’t worry Kath I’m not writing to any other Girls, they are all chaps!\nCheerio\n"

I’m not using it yet as I was able to get some at the canteen and also mum sent me some. Both yours and mums arrived on the same day so I’ve now got quite a stock in. I’ll leave yours till last as its the best and wont get creased up in my locker. Thanks very much dear.\nI laughed when I read about Old Sawyer (sorry Miss Sawyer) I wouldn’t take her out if she paid me.\nI’m glad to hear that the dog is alot better.\nWe went out last afternoon. We had a game of table tennis in a YMCA down here and some tea then went and saw Dive Bomber (didn’t think very much of it). We also saw that new film that you spoke of in your letter about the Russian. We have not yet made up our minds about where we are going this afternoon. It is lovely weather here today and we may take a stroll. I expect we will finish up at table tennis again.\nI’m writing this letter while we are waiting for dinner. We have just been on church parade, then from there we went round to the canteen and has to line up there for half an hour. I don’t spend much time in there as I don’t think it is worth while waiting so long for a drink and some cakes or buns but when we want cigs we have to.\nWell if I close quickly you know I’m going to dinner and I don’t think that I’ll have any time afterwards and dinner is within five minutes time.\nWell I’m back from dinner now and we are not going out yet as I’ve got this letter to write.\nOne of the chaps here has bought a wireless set from a bloke whos just leaving so we should soon have some music. We havent started it yet as there is no battery in it. I hope it goes alright. The chap thinks he can make something on it when we leave here as it was pretty cheap.\nWe had a nice lay in this morning thanks to the alteration of the clocks. We don’t get up on Sundays until 7 o’clock and the extra hour made it 8 according to the old time. I expect you got up about 11!\nI’m not having my photo taken down here, we were going next Saturday but they would not have been developed by the time we leave. We’ll have them done when we move.\nWell I stumped for any more news just now darling and if I’ve been writing a lot of tripe, please forgive me as I don’t know what I’ve been talking about.\nCheerio Kath I’ll write again soon.\nWith all my love and kisses\nBern\n"

      "letter":"14232057 Pte B Shepherd\n42 Platoon \n5 Company\n12th PTC\nNewport\nIsle of Wight\n\nDearest Kath,\nThanks for the two letters I recieved yesterday, that you wrote on 7th + 9th.\nI’m afraid I can’t tell you what I’m going in just yet as I don’t know myself but even if I did, I don’t surpose they would let me.\nThe weather here has been a proper bluepencil theese last few days. We’ve been out in it for hours on end and have got soaked thro’ to the skin. Its a wonder we don’t catch colds, I expect its because we are out in the open alday long. I’m glad I didn’t come here in the winter as it was bad enough yesterday trying to get the mud off of the equipment.\nThis early blackout is a bit of a trouble to us at night. We’ve got quite a few windows in our room which have to be blacked out every night about nine and then taken down again after ‘lights out’. If we don’t take them down again we’d be stiffled by the morning.\nThe army has not given us any more spud bashing (as we call it) but they are going to start the baby next week. lesson No 1 is \"Which way up to hold it\".\nI don’t know anything about the song the BBC are cutting out but it does not interest us at the moment as we can’t get it to go (we can’t even get two stations at once). When I started reading your paragraph about the BBC I though you meant they had banned those that were not clean. I expect I saw that pall of Burdens that you spoke of as I saw most of them.\nIts Wednesday tomorrow, out early night so I expect we shall go to the pictures or something, although there ain’t many good ones down here. I don’t know if they ever do any good ones in this dump.\nThe worst of going out of an evening is that you can’t get any cleaning done until the morning when we don’t get much time. We generally get told off after being out the night before. Stukk we must have some recreation and they can’t kill us altho’ they had a jolly good try up till now!\nDid you go round and see mum this week darling? She does want you to go round now and a gain as I asked her in my letter.\nIt looks good up on our notice board \"42 Platoon 4th Week\", I wonder where I shall be after I leave here? From what I’ve seen I shall not be anywhere near Ilford. Most likely it will be somewhere round where Craze has gone.\nWell dear I’ll put a brake on my pen now as I’m going to clean my shoes, make my bed, then have a lovely hot shower then to bed. I’ll be off as soon as my head touches my pillow.\nGoodnight darling I write again when my ATS girl lets me.\nMy greatest love,\nBern\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nPte B Shepherd\n42 Platoon \n5 Company\n12 PTC\nNewport\nIsle of Wight\n\nDearest Kath,\nThanks very much for your two letters darling. Sorry to read that you have to travel home alone at night, I’ll ask for my discharge so that I can accompany you.\nYou ask what is my objection to you joining the ATS. Well, if you did we should not see each other until after the war and in any case I don’t think it would suit you. Still, if you did want to join don’t take any notice of me.\nI see you were out in the rain going to Westminster that afternoon we were walking through fields for about 4 hours and we didn’t feel too good afterwards you can bet.\nI’m glad Ginty is home again. He will soon get used to using four legs again.\nOld Fry is abit dappy having her teeth out on holiday week ain’t she? I should have had them out afterward and chance whether they paid me for it.\nI can’t imagine Burden in the Forses but still I thought the same about myself until I was called up. I hope he is called up in September for his own sake, I can just imagine what it would be like if he started in November with iccles and snow hanging around.\nIn my last letter I said that most likely we would be going out Wednesday as it was our early night. Unfortunately they though that if we had an early night we might get slack so they kindly told us to change our rooms with another platoon. When we were finished it was too late to go out.\nI shall not be writing much more as I’m getting to bed early as we shall be up for an hour or two tomorrow night. We don’t get enough sleep as it is.\nGive my love to the family, the time will slip by until I see you all again. Cheerio sweet\nI’m thinking of you always\nYour ever loving\nBern\n"

W.\n\nDearest Kath,\nThanks very much for your letters (12th and 13th) and although I have not got much time I’ll try and answer them.\nIn letter you speak of Renes bright idea of calling me Bernard instead of Bern but if you knew how much I hate my full cristian name you would never have asked. I can’t tell you why I don’t like it but Bern sounds a lot better.\nI hope you enjoyed your cup of \"Usual\".\nI’m afraid the wireless wont go as it needs a new valve so when I do here a radio again it will be quite a change.\nI don’t know what to make of that money that Bucks are sending me. I’ve recieved one 5/- from them and I wrote and thanked them, (You spoke of the letter when you wrote to me but I have not recieved any more. I can’t understand Old Pasco twisting it though as shes bound to get found out. By the way tell them not to send any more letters until you here from me as they might come after I leave here and if there are any values in them they may never reach me.\nIt wont be long now before I go and by the time you recieve this piece of scribble we shall be near out [censored] week. It will be quite a change and we shall be getting down to our proper jobs and know what we are doing. The only thing we don’t like is loosing our pals as we shall never see each other again. I expect we will be split up all over the country.\nWe have had a pretty hard job of it theese last few days. Friday we had two Drills, a P.T. that was pretty stiff, then [censored] all the afternoon and to finish had a couple [censored] during the [censored]. On Monday and Tuesday we’ve got to be up at [censored] as we are doing [censored] trips on our feet. Still it ain’t to bad and I like it and its certainly doing me good.\nIt was raining this afternoon so we didn’t go out until after tea (4 o’clock) and to break my general rule I wrote to mum first as I owed her one 2 or three days ago. I generaly write to you first to make sure of it. I feel as if I could go on writing pages tonight but the hands of my watch say 10-10 and the lights out goes at 10-15 so I’m afraid I must close very shortly. I have sent the green envelopes to mum this week to let her see what they are like.\nPlease excuse the writing as I’ve been in a bit of a hurry to get it finished.\nWhen I get to my unit I’ll get some ink.\nSo Goodnight darling thanks for going round and seeing mum\nBern\n"

      "letter":"14232057 Pte B Shepherd\n42 Platoon \n5 Company\n12 PTC\nNewport\nIsle of Wight\n\nDearest Kath,\nThis is a funny way of starting a letter but I thought I’d warn you - I’m in a nice mood tonight and if anybody treads on my corns I shall show them a few things! We have been out on the range yesterday and today, an [censored] march each way, and it takes the go out of you after you have been roaming about the range all day. Its been lovely down here too, theese last two days although the sun was realy too hot for the range. The sun was beating down on us and I feel pretty rotten tonight. Last night I went to bed as soon as the cleaning was finished. \nWhat realy made me wild was this - After we got back from the range I boiled my rifle, cleaned it, cleaned all my brass, boots, etc and imagined that I would get finished by about 8.30. Just as I had finished we were told that we had to blanco our equipment tonight. The way I had been rushing about to get my cleaning done then they say do the blancoing made me feel sick! To crown it all, as I walked over to the table to write this letter someone dropped a heavy gun on my toe. I feel fine!\nWell, now I’ve got that off my chest Kath I’ll start my letter. I sent you a letter dated saturday but I never sent it until this morning as we left very early for the range on Monday I never had time to post it. Today, however, I got a chap who wasn’t going with us to post it for me. I’m sorry theres such a big space between the last two letters darling. Thanks very much for your letter dated 17th. I never got it until tonight as we were away all day.\nPlease don’t apologise for not writing, thats my privilege. Sorry you havent felt to well, I hope you’re OK now. I should think you could guess about the A.T.S. You get them posted near some soldiers and Bobs your uncle with some of the chaps.\nDennis now engaged? He will have to keep to the straight and narrow path for a change wont He? Tell him he has all my sympathy (I’m only joking).\nWe went out on some night opperations the other night. Quite interesting but I like my bed best. Its funny but it corresponds with the lot that Renes Husband had on Friday.\nYes, we have church parade every sunday. The C of E, RC etc all have different parades.\nI’m glad Frank is enjoying himself, I think that sort of life suits him better than office. I can see what a mug I’ve been to stick to it.\nUtter tripe.\nIf I’ve rushed through this letter just write to the S Major and tell him off, I bet he could keep up a good row with anyone if he wanted to. He shouts at us but unfortunately we ain’t allowed to say a word.\nWell darling I don’t think there is much else to say. I didn’t think I would get it done in time but I can write pretty quick when I’m left alone which I have tonight. I’ve got just 10 minutes now to finish off and get into bed. I shall sleep like a log now I’m sure. Its not much good going to bed before time as theres always some who don’t feel like bed and we can make a row if we like. Well I wont be able to write any more now as the corp has just come in telling another of his yarns. He can spin them!\nWell goodnight dear I’ll write again as soon as I can. Please don’t be wild with me for not writing although you have every right to. Cheerio.\nYour everlasting love\nBern\n"

(Thats the usual way I start isn’t it?)\nWe are all getting tuned up for going now although theres only one chap who has had anything definate about the day and place. I expect when we get to our new residence (can’t spell it) we’ll be saying \"I wish we were back in the I.O.W.\"\nWe are also rather heated up as there is a compition on among the different companies that came with us. Drill, Cleanliness of Rooms, Sports, P.T. and firing. The winning company gets a splash up including beer. We thought that we hadn’t a ghost of a chance by the way the C.S.M. has been shouting at us but up till now we are leading by three points. We now have only the sports which will be held on saturday and if we put up a decent show then it means a feed for us that evening.\nNo dear I havent heard from Frank yet, by you letter it seems that he is too buisy with the dances, converts, etc. Evidently the Navy is slightly different to my firm.\nCraze is on a mine sweeper, eh? He has been in the Navy 4 or 5 months hasn’t he? An old timer.\nI don’t know what to make of that money as I havent recieved anything but I will make enquires and see if I can find anything about it. Ask her if she has the counterfoil for the P.O.\nI don’t know my writing is so bad that you can’t read it or else I’m tipsy but I’d swear to my word that I told you your picture was great. Its getting quite a lot of use too, I keep having a peep at it every now and again. I may be nuts but it acts like a tonic.\nMum spoke of me having my photo taken but thats impossible as the prints wouldn’t be done in time. We were going before but we wanted the uniforms to get worn in a bit first.\nWell I must close now as I’ve still got some letters to write and so\nBye Bye dearest, I hope to be with you in a week or two, although theres no promises.\nYours till the stars loose their glory\nBern\n"

It is now 9-00 and I’ll stop at 9.30, that will give me just time to write home. Before I start I must wish you many happy returns as I expect your birthday will be pretty close when you recieve it. I’m afraid that I shall not be home for it but we must live in hopes that it wont be long.\nI am going into the RA as I hoped, and by the looks of it there is no fear of anything happening like you spoke of in your letter. You will soon know what I mean.\nWe won the competition between the companies. I think I told you about it in my letter last week. We had the dinner tonight and it was real good with a band in attendance as well.\nWe’ve had the hardest day of all today since we’ve been down here. I certainly took all the go out of me and if you find I stop suddenly I’ve dropped off to sleep. They gave us an assult course, Drill, two more asault courses, and P.T. before dinner, then finished up with a short route march through the gas chamber then back on the march again. The gas chamber would not have been so bad if we had had out resperators on but we had to go in without them. It gives you a head ache, tooth ache and every other ache, makes you feel sick and generally rotten but it went off very shortly.\nSorry to hear Miss Sawyer & Craze have parted, although I myself think its for the best.\nWell darling I’m sorry but the time has gone by too quickly so cheerio, you’ll get another letter in a couple of day.\nGoodnight to the best girl on earth.\nBern\nP.S. please excuse writing and spelling - its the pencil. \nPPS (10.00) I have not recieved that 5/- yet and I’ve made enquires but hasn’t arrived.\nBern\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nGnr B Shepherd\nA Battery\nE Block\nA70 CTR RA\nRoyal Citadol\nPlymouth\n\nDearest Kath,\nAs you can see from my address, I am back in good old England. I’m afraid I’m not so near to Ilford as I should like to be but I suppose it can’t be helped. I don’t really know whether to apply for 48 hrs leave as it is so far away because it is such a long journey and by the time I got home it would mean bed then back again. Anyway, I should like to know what you think about it darling as I should like you and mum to make my mind up for me. \nWe left Newport this morning as 6-00 and arrived here at Plymouth at 4-00 this afternoon so we were travelling 10 hours and it was pretty boring by the time we had finished.\nThere was only two of us came from the I.O.W. and as the other chap came from another company we did not know each other until today. On the train some lady gave us 2/- each to spend on some food.\nThis place has got its advantages and disadvantages - we have much better beds and a loud speaker in every room which you just switch on but we have no lockers as we had on I.O.W. to put out things in. We don’t have all the \"spit and polish\" as we had there either. It doesn’t look as though this place has had anybody in it for quite a while as the room is in quite a mess but we are going to get it all cleared up tomorrow night. We have had only one meal here today so we can’t judge the food very well but it seems O.K.\nI am not here in Plymouth for good as this is only another training centre and I expect I shall be here for about another 6 weeks although I don’t know for sure.\nYou will notice I am now Gunner Shepherd instead of Private. They like to make it sound better in the R.A.\nI am writing this letter with the row of a fight droning in my ears from the wireless. Its stopped now, it must have known what I was writing.\nHave you spoken to Miss Pascoe about that money. I record someone else as got that. It seems funny that that one should be lost.\nI’m sorry I can’t answer your last letter but I’m afraid with the rush that had this morning I must have shoved it in such a good hiding place that I can’t find it. I’m very sorry Kath. Anyway, I know that you said that you never received a letter which I spoke of your photo. Well I know for certain that I acknowledged recieving it so it must have got lost. It seems as though the post there wasn’t to good. Still, I’m not there anymore.\nWell dear how are you and all the rest at Sunny side road? The weather hasn’t been so bad today thank goodnes. Mum said she had a nice holiday in Wales. It made a nice change for her anyway.\nWell I think I will close now Kath as I must unpack my things and get them ready for the morning.\nGoodnight darling\nBern\n"

R.A.\nRoyal Citadel\nPlymouth\nDevon\n\nDear Kath,\nI thought I would start this letter now as I’ve a few minutes to spare after dinner which is a thing we never had at Newport. I’ve been here for nearly two days now so I am now able to sum this place up a bit. The work itself is jolly interesting although there seems to be a decent bit of hard work attached to it, and we don’t work such long hours not half the polishing. On the other hand, the Barrack room is rotten and there is nowhere to put your cloths. The food isn’t anywhere near the standard of our other place but I think I should rather stop here than go back to the I.O.W. as there is not much square bashing (marching) here.\nI found your letter in my spare Battledress pocket that was at the bottom of my Kit bag. You spoke of me having my photo done, well dear we have not been issued with cap badges yet but I will get it done. Ofcourse you could not understand why I didn’t get it done at Newport but we were not billeted in Newport at all, we were about 2 miles away in some barracks but censor would not let me say that. Being that far away we could only get to the shops on Saturday afternoons, and as we only had 2 Saturdays off owing to different duties, there wasn’t much time. It was a wonderful place where our barracks stood at Parkhurst (near Newport). There was a prison one side and an institution on the other and 2 pubs before you got to town. 9/30 I’ve recieved your letter dated 25th. They forwarded ut on from I.O.W. therefore it took a little longer to reach me.\nI can’t remember when I said that I boiled my rifle, thats the worst of having a bad memory. Anyway, its quite correct. Boiling water is poured through the barrel after it has been fired to get all the muck from the pores of the steel.\nI’m very sorry I’m causing so much trouble about that money. It seems funny if she sent them both and they’ve got lost. Tell Mr Lee not to bother sending me cigarettes as I have now stopped smoking. I wasn’t going to tell you as I might not keep it up for very long, although I havent had one for a week.\nWe have been issued with our cap badges now. They are not the usual RA badges but just a small flower thing. We can wear the old ones if we care to buy them. \nYou will notice my address has slightly changed.\nWe are going to have a look round the town tomorrow and see what its like. We didn’t see much of it coming from the station as we went by van and we have not been out since we got here. We are working on one of the big guns down here and I’m beginning to like it. The shells are a bit heavier than the ordinary rifle bullet you can bet!\nDid you mean it when you said that Ella is leaving Bucks or is she just moaning as you all do. We here mean ten times worse than that but in any case its a soldiers privilege to grouse.\nWell darling I think that is all for this evening. I think I shall be able to write more frequently to you now as we get some time to our selfs.\nJust before I finish I’ve just remembered something. We do not get any leave for another 8 weeks at least so they have settled that question for me. Still, it will soon slip by and we will be together again as before.\nBye bye dear\nYour ever Sweetheart\nBern\n"

I forgot I was back in good old England.\nPlease excuse the writing but I’m laying on the bed resting the pad in my hand. We have no table here to write on as we had at Newport. Still, you should be able to read it if you clean your glasses.\nWe went round Plymouth yesterday and had a decko at it. Its certainly a bit different to Newport as you could walk thro Newport in 5 mins but we got lost in Plymouth yesterday. Theres a lovely view from our barracks of Plymouth as we are right on top of a steep hill and looking on to the town is just like being an aeroplane. If you look from the otherside there is the sea and boats. Its more interesting down here anyway.\nI think you got the wrong idea about my leave, I meant instead of the 48 hrs, I would have it with my seven days and have two extra days then. But thats all washed out now as we don’t get leave for at least another 8 weeks. While I was at I.O.W. I quite expected to get leave as soon a I got here altho I told you otherwise.\nI’m sorry you’re not feeling too well or rather wasn’t when you wrote to me. I hope you feel better now dear - it must be all that hard work at Bucks. Ask old Warren for a few months off.\nWe have been laying out on the sea front this afternoon and to look at the people bathing you’d never think there was a war on. There is a lovely prominard here although there is no sands or beach of any kind. I expect it would be nice for a holiday in peace time but it would be too quiet for my liking.\nI’m sorry to have to tell you but my pencil has gone on strike and refused to think of anything else to write, so I will apply the brake.\nGive my regards to your mother, Rene, Tim, and may we be back together again soon darling going for our usual walks as if no war had ever parted us.\nGoodbye Kath until my next\nYour Loving\nBern\nPS I’ve just been out and as we came back early I’ve picked this letter up again. We have been along the prom and we settled ourselves on deck chairs with some apples. I dozed off to sleep for about half an hour and made myself feel rotten but there was a nice breeze and I soon felt fresh again.\nYou will notice I have knocked out a few words on page 4. They were ‘Too select.’ but as we have been round the back streets this evening I’ve changed my mind. Talk about London slums!\nWould you get Franks address for me as I’ve lost it and I can find a bit of time to write him a letter now.\nGoodnight\nBern\n"

      "letter":"14232057 Gnr B Shepherd\nA Battery\n3 Troop\nA70 CTR RA\nRoyal Citadel\nPlymouth\n\nDearest Kath,\nI should be able to write a bit more readable letter tonight as I am in the Barracks libary. Its very nice in here, and its one of the few places where there is peace and quietness. I began to get the boys here jealous today as I recieved 5 letters which I concider a good record. Best of all three of them were from you. One of them was addressed to the Isle of Wight so it has been delayed quite a while. However I’ll put them in date order and kill three beetles with one rock.\nYou ask what I am doing here. We have started on one of the coastal guns. The 6\". This is the only one we work on while we are here and we are generaly on it about ⅓ of the day. Its very interesting but I expect we shall be fed up by the end of a month. We practiced on dummy guns with dud shells although we have spent a couple of afternoons going over a proper ones. Its pretty hard work on some parts of the gun but as we take it in turns its not so bad. There is quite a lot to firing one of theese large guns and you must keep your wits about you throughout the whole of the drill or else there is soon a slip up.\nWe are also learning all about aeroplanes, their different shapes and how they fly and all that tripe. Don’t ask me why as I don’t know. They say it is so that we can identify them when operating on Gun sites but goodnes knows why they show us how they work. We are learning semaphore too (its not spelt right) and all the ins and outs of shells. Today they gave us some bayonet practice, the first since we left I.O.W. I thought we had finished with all that but it doesn’t look like it, does it? You might tell Burden I have recieved his letter, please Kath but I - well I can’t think of an excuse so make one up for me will you.\nAccording to one of the regular RA that we got talking to it takes roughly between 6-7 hours to London. It all depends what sort of train you catch.\nI certainly shouldn’t trust Old Pascoe with any more money, its as plain as pikestaff what she has done, especially when she has \"distroyed the counterfoil\". How did she come to have a finger in the pie, anyway?\nSo Kath, Bristows brother is going to the Isle of Wight is he? I think I should rather be in my own boots than his. It wasn’t to bad there but I’m half way through my training now.\nTalking about cecnsor, you know that piece I put in some weeks back about having an ensor concert and they knocked out the place it was in, well it was only in the gym. They knocked out the word \"gym\" as it would show enemy agents that we were in Barracks. That reminds me, you didn’t know that we were in Barracks did you? They were quite fair size barracks and although they were mostly all brick buildings we were in wooden huts which were far better as they were more modern. Every hut had got its own shower, baths, and basin with cold and hot water where as the old buildings hadn’t. They were alot better than what we have now. The building that we sleep in now dates back to 1700 I should think.\nI don’t think my ‘waves’ (as you call them) are quite so short as they were. They don’t trouble about the top so much as long as the back and sides are clean.\nI’m sorry that there was all that trouble for nothing, going round to my place (I can’t very well call it my place now).\nSo you are now 18 years old, eh dear? Only another 47 more and you’ll have the old age pension! Do you have to fill up any forms to get your money?\nI’m sorry I wasn’t home for your birthday, about 2 weeks ago I was thinking about coming home and now everything is just going on as before but still when I do get home we will have to make up for it. The time will soon slip round and then I shall be home for at leased a week. Its something to look forward to, anyway.\nWell darling I must close now and am going to pop in next door and have a drink. I’ve only had one side I’ve been at Plymouth so don’t start passing any remarks.\nGoodnight Kath\nYour Bern\n"

One wrote on 31st and the other 1st.\nAnyone would think you didn’t beleive me giving up smoking. Well its a fact! I am giving it up whilst I am on training anyway, although I can’t see myself keeping it up if I get posted on a gun site where there isn’t much action.\nI’m glad that they have come to a settlement about our money and it will certianly be fairer to send Craze & Windsor some too. I can’t understand why they didn’t start that in the beginning.\nHere is a rough drawing of our badge.\n[drawing]\nI have bought myself an ordinary RA Badge for walking out, they look a bit more like a badge, don’t they? I expect the next thing I shall be buying is a new cap. The artillery walking out cap is red and blue, I expect you have seen them. Our other caps are getting dirty anyway. Have you bought one of our badges yet?\nYes, I knew that I had only put a 2d stamp on that letter but when I went to post it that was all I had, no one else had a stamp and the NAAFI hadn’t any either! I knew that you would rather pay the extra penny than not recieve a letter.\nI had a letter from Frank this week so I already knew his address but thanks for the slip all the same. He didn’t say much in it, I can’t imagine him sitting down to writing a long letter. Anyway, he was writing it in the sick room, having 24 hours for vaccination. He said he is getting on O.K. although the work is hard. He asked how you were and said he hadn’t recieved any letter from Burnie.\nI laughed about that \"too select\" quiery. You got hold of the wrong end of the stick thanks to my wonderful explanations. I meant that the two words I crossed out were TOO SELECT. Now do you get it?\nOn the wireless just now is a play showing the war right from the beginning when it was first declared. Its jolly interesting and I’m writing this and listening at the same time. I wonder if you’re listening to the very same program.\nThe food here isn’t as bad as I painted it at first. We get quite good stuff and generaly its 4 hot means a day. Today we had sausages and bacon for breakfast , Shepherds pie, carrots, & turnips & rice for Dinner, Fish and chips for tea, and soup & bread and a plate of rice for supper. Its a wonder I’m not getting fat, although I think I’ve put on weight since I joined this new firm.\nWe were peeling potatoes last night and didn’t get finished until 7-30 so we could not go out. This evening we had to attend a lecture after time therefore we couldn’t go out again. Thats not all, I’m on the fire party tomorrow and I’m just wondering whether they will be able to find anything for Saturday. Still, in the army you work 24 hours a day.\nWell Kath I think I will close now as I want to post it before I go to bed so bye bye dear I’ll be writing again before long.\nYours Everlasting\nBern xxxxxxxxxx\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nGnr B Shepherd\nA Battery\n3 Troop\nA70 CTR RA\nRoyal Citadel\nPlymouth\nDevon\n\nDearest Kath,\nI got you two letters both this morning darling one is Thursdays and the other Fridays. I am writing this on Saturday afternoon. You will remember I said that we were unable to go out on Wed, Thurs, or Friday owing to different duties and that I hoped to go out on Saturday. Well, being on the fire party Friday night, I am on until tonight as we do 24 hours at a stretch. Anyway, its pouring with rain and doesn’t encourage going out much. We slept in a cell last night. It was an underground room inside the wall that surrounds this castle. There were thick iron bars over the small window and great iron doors. I expect years ago the prisoners were locked in there. The fireparty always sleeps in this room. I should like to see a bomb that would penetrate it. The walls of our Barrack room are 3 ft thick!\nWe had a church service on Thursday at 11.30, so we had to get dressed up in our suits. The church is next door to our block and is a pretty decent building and is not so old as much of this place. I expect old twallin couldn’t very well refuse to let you go to the service as it was a national day of prayer. It would give him a bad name in the vicars eyes.\nI feel sorry for poor Albert Peak going to his doom like that without knowing whats coming. I wrote to Frank and told him about Albert and Truelove. (What a memory I’ve got). I made a note of that bloke Truelove on a piece of paper then lost it but I believe I have it right. He was a Headmaster and he kicked the bucket, thats right isn’t it?\nSo Burnie is having his medical next week. It looks as though he will be called up just in time for the cold weather. I can imagine 5-15 on a November morning especialy when your not used to it.\nYou ask \"how is the non smoking going on?\" When I make up my mind to do something I do it (sometimes) anyway I’m a non smoker now and I don’t intend to start again for quite a time. The real reason why I stopped was that before I left the I.O.W. we had a farewell spree up and left me broke. I never had a cigarette for 2 days and that made me think of the idea. I had a note on my but if I had broken into that it would have disappeared. I’m glad I’ve stopped it now as we are allowed to smoke 3 parts of the day and that would mean 20-30 fags a day. \nYes dear in another 7 weeks I should be on my way home. I shall be knocking on a certian door in Sunnyside road and someone will come rushing to the door. It seems more like a fairy story that is repeated over and over again but it will soon some true now. I’m counting the weeks off as they go.\nDamn Cheek! Do you think I can answer letters from memory then? I’m not an expert at answering letters, sorry!\nWell, I think I must close now Kath as I’m getting ready for tea. So bye bye darling only another 7 weeks remember.\nYours,\nBern\n"

We don’t get anything like that every day.\nI’m sorry to say that its you that has gone crazy Kath. You ask me if I’m sure that I’m in the Artillery! I wear the ordinary Artillery badge for walking out also the Artillery lanyard and flashes, live in an Artillery barracks and mucks about 6\" guns allday, so I don’t think I’m in the Tank corps. Seriously though sweet that drawing of mine was pretty accurate and that gauntlet that you drew belongs to a different corps alltogether (I think.) Anyway, I’ll do a bit more scetching.\n[drawing]\nI hope you havent got a badge yet as I should like to buy you one and send it down (or rather up). So if you havent got one, don’t!\nWe went to the pictures last Saturday night after our duty was over and saw \"First of the few\". We get films now, bit of a change from I.O.W. It was a jolly good film, the best war picture I’ve seen. I think so anyway.\nI see is another change round at Bucks. Fancy putting Childie on the machine, the sparks will fly now! When are you taking over Warrens place?\nWhere is Barbara? She is in the midlands isn’t she? Someone (I forget who it was) told me that she was returning to Ilford while I was at Bucks but they must have been talking out of the back of their head. Ten to one it was you.\nWe are going across the water this afternoon to the other side of the bay to see some guns that actualy will fire. The others that are here are only dummies. We have already been over there once to give us a rough idea of it. On theese on the other side there are all the clocks and dials we havent got here.\nWell darling I will close now partly because I havent got any more to say and I must write to Burnie tonight and we are duty Troop again. We have to fill sandbags so I’m told unless the Bom is having us on. Still I shall soon find out as I’m on it in ¼ of an hour. Its quarter to six now.\nSomeone has just reminded me that we have been here a fortnight. I seems more like a week to me. Doesn’t the time fly dear?\nI’ll be back again before we know where we are.\nBye Bye Kath\nYours Everlasting,\nBern\nP.S. Thanks very much for envelope. I forgot it last time.\nGoodnight darling\nBern\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nGnr Shepherd\nA Battery\n3 Troop\nA70 CTR RA\nRoyal Citadel\nPlymouth\n\nDear Kath,\nI was going out tonight but they got us building a sandbag wall this evening and by the time we had finished, it was not worth while going out. Who told you the army pay wasn’t very large? I’m saving money now that I don’t smoke. I didn’t know anything about mum buying you a present. What was it or ain’t I supposed to know?\nI’m a bit dazed about this Pasco affair. One day you write that she is going out with Pullen and then calmy say a couple of days later that Craze is taking her out. It doesn’t make sence to me. Im my opinion, Craze is letting the navy down. He is worse than I thought! Where is he posted to now?\nI can just imagine you when you read this letter. By that time the full affects of Wednesdays cooking would have come on unless ofcourse you turn to the tin opener. I myself would use the tin opener as it would cost quite a lot for a funeral theese days and flowers are an awful price.\nSo you have the sirens now, do you? We got pretty used to those things while we were at Newport I.O.W. Generaly we got 3 warnings a day but although we expected plenty of bombs as our place stood a mile with its big asphalt square we never recieved any. That Sunday that our boys went over to France the planes and funs were going all day. I can’t understand why that place hasn’t been blown sky high years ago (It would be a damn good idea if no one was in it). We have had one alert sinse we’ve been here but it only lasted about 5 minutes.\nIts just 900 clock now. Victor Silvester has just gone off and here comes the news. Doesn’t sound to good does it? Still, another 6 months and it may be over and I’ll be home again for good. Nothing will part us then darling.\nWell, I think that is all I can scrape out of what little brain matter I have, so I will wish you goodnight and look after yourself and don’t eat too many of those \"self cooked meals\".\nGive my love to your mother, Rene and Tim.\nGoodnight dear\nYours for ever\nBern\n"

Its the first time that I’ve heard of a letters making annoying sounds, I expect you must have put it on the gramophone. I wasn’t in the least waspy when I wrote it, anyway. I’m sorry if I havent answered all your questions darling I can’t think how I could have missed them but I will go through the letters I have here and find them. I’ll make sure I don’t miss any more. You have not asked any questions here so I’m safe this time.\nSo you’ve started first aid. Is this lecture that you went to on the 8th the first one? I don’t think I should be much good at sticking peoples heads on or bandaging them up as I don’t suppose I should do it neat enough. One of the chaps in our troop made a mistake last week while working on the dummy guns and had his finger broken in two places. His finger is got so much bandage on it that its 3 times its usual size. I expect that you will be pretty efficient (another word spelt wrong) by the time I come home on leave so that if I get my nose jammed in the carriage door you’ll be able to do the doctrine.\nI hear that you went round and saw mum on wednesday night dear as Claude wrote on Wednesday to me and he tacked it on the end.\nI’m afraid the news down here is very little and there isn’t much to talk about. We were on fatigues again tonight until 7 o’clock and that completes the whole week. Altho’ that is all I can find to write, if I could pop round to Sunnyside road for a couple of hours darling I believe I could keep up with you (and thats saying a mouthful)\nSo Goodnight Kath take care of yourself\nYours, Bern\nPS I hope you have completly recovered from your attack of food poisoning.\nB\n"

So I’ll now start.\nThank you for your letters that you wrote on the 10th and 11th. Sorry if I’ve been sarcastic, its a discusting thing to do so I’ll make a point of not doing it again till next time. And thats a promise!\nI’m sorry darling but I have not had my photo taken yet. I was going to last Saturday but I had quite a few things to buy and when I started looking for one I couldn’t find any. I’ve been told now where there is one and if I can manage to get out next Saturday I’ll have it done.\nI hope you enjoyed your weekend at your Aunts. Does she live far away?\nI’m glad Rene took over the cooking, it saved the docter a lot of trouble anyway. Tell her she is damn awkward to cut her finger with a tin opener.\nI thought that was quite a good crack about Burnie \"would probably be writing soon\". That last letter he wrote took him about a month to write. He kept adding a bit more when he had time.\nI never told you that we didn’t have any raids on the Isle of Wight. All I said was something about being evacuated to I.O.W. to get away from the blitz, and you jumped in the trap.\nYes, a 3/6 increase will come in handy wont it?\nI’m confined to barracks this week from Monday to Monday, and I’ve not commited any crimes! I’m on PAD duties. I’m just about sick of duties and I don’t think there could be a worse place for them than this. Every night they find something. Tonight we were cleaning up the dummy guns and making them shine. It didn’t make much difference to me as I couldn’t go out owing to the PAD (P.A.D. is another name for ARP. Passive Air Defence).\nMum has told me that when she asked you to go round on Sunday she meant for you to go to tea. She wasn’t quite sure whether you understood.\nWe have just been preparing the beds of the boys that have gone out. They are now fixed in such a way that they will colapse when they sit on them or they have rifles, tin hats, Brooms etc fixed in the springs so it wont be too comfortable.\nWell darling I’ve now been here nearly 3 weeks so that I shall soon be moving to another training barracks at the other side of the bay. We spend another month there and then we should be coming home for a whole week. It wont be a terrible long time Kath and it would be worth while waiting years.\nSaturday Night we went and saw \"Flying Fortress\" and also Dead end Kids. Two jolly good films, unfortunately I had seen the latter.\nI think I will pack up now and get into bed as it turned 9.30 and I’ll get an early night for a change. Mind you, I shall not get to sleep until eleven as thats impossible unless you’re stone deaf.\nGive my love to all at your home.\nGoodnight Kath\nJust Yours\nBern\n"

By your earlier letter you sounded as though you wasn’t to keep about going but you must have had a fine time with that load of fruit hanging arround. I think it is discusting for you to make yourself sick with them!\nI should love to sample some of your cooking some day. I don’t believe its as bad as I make out.\nI don’t know! Can’t you controll the boys in the office. When I retired I placed you in full charge of them and you allow them to play about with scent during working hours. I’ll write to Swallin about this.\nPlease dear don’t take any notice of what I write! I write what I would say if you were here but it doesn’t always sound the same.\nToday we were speaking to one of our officers and he said that we should be here an extra week before we go over the other side. So that we would do 5 weeks here instead of the month, then a month on the other side of the bay.\nI’m still stuck in this dump as you know and can’t go out until Monday.\nYesterday evening I spent the time by going on the wall with some more who are on with me and watching the ships coming and going. We then went into the Libary to read until supper time. I thenwrote a letter to Mum after supper. Tonight I have some mending to do. I’ve got to sew up the bottoms of my denim trousers. (They are our overall trousers that we wear to work in)\nJust a I was writing the above words a bluepencil Bom came in and told us all we were on spud bashing. So for the last hour we have been peeling potatoes. That is the sort of thing you have to be careful of in this place. If you don’t either go out or hide yourself you are caught for fatigues.\nI’ve just had a book chucked at me that someone has sent a chap on the other side of the room. Its called \"The Road to total War\". He said a few words about total war!\nWell dear I’m coming near to my close now as I’m going to get on with my mending.\nJust remember it wont be very long before I have my leave and that extra week wont make much difference. When the time does come and we look back to the time we were on Paddington station it wont seem very long.\nWell, give my love to all at home, and how I must close with all my love and xxxxx\nGoodnight Kath\nYours for ever\nBern\n"

By the way you speak of it you have not got that letter yet unless you have put it down funny.\nWho said I wasn’t going to be sarcastic any more? I don’t think I did unless I wrote it in my sleep one night. I believe you read my letter wrongly.\nI expect I shall be moving about Tuesday week although I’m not sure. Actualy I like moving about as it makes quite a change. I was fed up with this place the first week we were here so I shall not be sorry to leave here. I don’t think there could be a worse place for getting time off.\nI’m glad you were able to see \"Gone with the wind\". I suppose you booked the seats for it, did you? I wish I could have been there with you darling. I don’t expect I shall see it as I’m moving about and I’m bound to be unlucky and miss it.\nI’m not suprised at Bristows brother not liking the wonderful Isle of Wight as its not all honey. You might tell him that he had better come down this place if he likes it. We peel potatoes for an hour 3 times a week, polish guns at least once a week and on fridays have to polish our floor and spring clean the room for Saturday inspection. Thats all in our \"spare\" time. Besides that, every where we go we have to double just as if we were in the glass house. Still we are only here another week. I wonder what the next place is like?\nHave any of my letters been censored from this place? One chap in this room has had two of his censored. They pick about 1 in 50 although I can’t see any sence in it.\nI am nearly at the end of my weeks P.A.D. altho’ I have to stop in this week end. I was hoping that I would be able to get another chap to take my place on saturday who was not going out but unfortunately nearly everyone is in on saturday on duties. Some on Fire pump and others on guard so they can’t take my place for me. I may chance it and go out, I should not be missed unless the warning went but the other week a couple of us were on Fire pump (Saturday it was) and wasn’t off duty until 6.30 but we went out at 5.30. The warning went about 6.40, so if it had gone 15 mins before that we would have been caught. That is the only warning we have had so far.\nWell dear I think I will close now so Goodnight Kath I’ll be writing again very soon. So as Henry is just playing on the wireless, heres till the next time.\nYours for ever\nBern\nxxxx\n"

I came on at 600 last night and am on until 600 tonight. We do 2 hours on and eight off so it is pretty easy. I was on last night from 10 till 12 and this morning again 8 till 10. Last night seemed to go alot quicker than this morning as I had the \"halt who goes there\" business and it made the time go. It was a bit of a job, though, as it was pouring with rain, windy, and pitch dark. Ofcourse we have a shelter when its raining. Everyone that comes in after blackout is halted and has to report to the guard room. The A.T.S. are the only ones that give us any trouble. I think they’re scared to go into the guard room or else they are too stuck up. Trust women for that! It was quite a joke the other night when one of the other chaps was on. We have to stop all civillians that enter the barracks to make sure that they are allowed in. Well, this chap kept stopping them and the guard commander kept shouting \"Don’t stop him, hes old so and so\" In the end this chap got fed up and when the next one came (a man and woman) he just let them go through. When they got round onto the square they must have realised something was wrong and asked a sgt. Major if they ‘were tresspassing;.\nThe old S M went for the sentry alright!\nWell now back to the usual stuff. I’m sorry to say there are now no photographers in Plymouth. I managed to get out on Saturday as some other chap took my place and I spent nearly two hours hunting for one but I was unsuccessful. I asked the guard commander today if there was any and he said that there wasn’t one to his knowledge. Ten to one they were all knocked out in the blitz as its in a shocking state.\nI recieved a letter from Burnie, I expect I shall write to him tonight if I find time. By the look of the weather I shall not be going out this evening.\nI’ve just been taking the prisoners for a walk round the wall and when I came back I started writing something that I had already said. Hence the scribble.\nI didn’t darn those socks that night, so I have still got them to do but I’ll do it alright when I feel like it. I think I can do it alright anyway.\nI’ve got a ton of time to write this letter in but I’m damned if I can think of any more news (these brains are getting worn out with all the hard work). Really, though, there isn’t much to talk about when you are stuck in these four walls for a week. Its a big place and you can go for a walk round it but all there is to see is solid grey walls and I’ve seen quite enough of them.\nWell darling I’m sorry I am stopping now. I feel rather cadish finishing now when I’ve plenty of time still, I’ll write to mum now as I should have written before. So I’ll say bye-bue now hoping to see you before very long.\nGive my love to yours brother, Rene, and Tim.\nYours,\nBern\n"

Its just the thing for me, as you can guess its a bit of a job keeping paper smooth when there is no locker to put it in. I didn’t know that you knew my birthday as I can’t remember ever telling you. Still, I can’t rely on my memory too much.\nI have also recieved your letter in which you feel abit waspy to start with. I hope you are feeling a bit better now. Is it one of your wild threats about leaving Bucks or is it a fact? I’ve heard that threat so many times from different people that it doesn’t sink in very far.\nI’m suprised that Frank isn’t looking too good. I can’t understand it as I should think he would be more at home with a bit of hard work than office stuff. It isn’t doing me any harm, anyway. If you had seen me while I was at the I.O.W.

I meant to write a letter in the train and then you would have recieved a long better but the way I felt yesterday I would only have filled it with a lot of soft tripe that would make you feel 10 times worse. I believe everyone felt more or less the same in our carriage as hardly a word was spoken until we got about half way, when a chap asked me for a light. We then started about the weather and that broke the ice. I raked round and found a few of my remaining palls when I reached the Citadel and slept with them for the night. At eleven this morning we (fourteen of us) caught a lorry to Fort Staddon where we are now. I recond it will be jolly interesting here once we get stuck into it, altho by the looks of it there is quite a bit to learn in the 3 months (its only a 3 month course by the way). What I don’t like about the place is that it is \"out of the way\". The nearest place of any size is Plymouth and it means going by either train or boat. This is another old fort and is stuck right on top of a hill and it blows your head off if it isn’t screwed on tightly. Anyway, they have supplied us with an extra blanket here. As this is an \"out of the way\" dump, they have their own cinima here which shows once a week, two houses and as they are free I’m going round to see those that are being shown tonight. I know you wont mind darling as it means that I shall now be able to write so much to you. I don’t think that I shall be able to keep up my 6 page letters now darling as theese sheets are about twice as big as the others but I shall never stop writing the same amout. In fact after this short time I have had with you dear I believe I could write all night.\nYou now seem to me to be a part of myself which has been dragged away from me. If only I could explain myself I would but words would never explain it. Still - never mind, the answer is in those seven days of joy that I had with you.\nThank you for everything.\nWell dear to bring myself to earth, what was the coat like that you got? I’m glad that your mother came down to meet you, and getting the coat took your mind off a bit.\nI’m sorry dear but I must close now as it is tea time and I don’t want to miss that if I can help it. I’ll write to mum after I’ve been to see theese films and if I’ve still time I tack a bit more on here afterwards. So bye bye for now Kath give my love to Mother, Rene, and Tim and give yourself the best kiss in the world for me.\nJust\nBern\nPS I’ve just come back from the show, it was OK we saw a copple of old films, one called Dusty airlines or something and a papie film The man in the flying trapeeze. It was quite good. Goodnight, love, sleep well and me know what old Warren says when you get back.\nBern\nPPS I put earlier that it wouldn’t be a long letter but its grown bigger than I thought.\n"

Also the nib isn’t much good and I wondered if you could send me a few down as theese were all I could get and its 10 to 1 that I shall not see Plymouth again for a week or two. Its almost a waist of time going there, as you sometimes have to wait half an hour or so for the ferry, its an half an hours walk to the ferry and the last one leaves Plymouth about 7.30 owing to the blackout. So you see we don’t get much time and when we get there, there is nothing to do except g to the pictures. If we do that theres no time for shopping.\nI am getting used to my new home by this time and I quite believe it will be an interesting course although theres an awful lot to learn and it makes we sweat to think of it. They say they have picked the brainy chaps for this course but I recond the bloke that picked me must have been cross eyed. If I’m brainy I pity the rest. We’ve been doing morse and semephore up till now although four of us are badly handycaped as the rest of the squad have already had a fortnight signal training and know morse inside out. Therefore the instructors are rapping out morse and we can’t tell A from Z.\nAnyway I know the (My Spelling) morse A-Z. We get a terrible lot to learn in our spare time and they have supplied us with a large note book and a text book for swotting up. The signal wing is looked on with great respect in the fort and are trying to swell out heads by calling us students! What an army.\nThe weather has been very nice today and the wind has dropped quite a bit so, although we had made up out minds to stay in, we went out. We went down the front and after getting through various coils of barbed wire and following a roughly cut path down the cliffe, we reached the beach. We sat there for quite a while, studying out books, then came back to tea. Now I’m writing to you darling.\nOfcourse I have not recieved your letter yet but I am looking forward to one tomorrow although I don’t supose there is much news as it was only a week ago today that we were all round mums/ I shall always remember my first leave, wont you dear?\nWhile I’m cadging for some pen nibs could you send a bit of blotting paper darling? Don’t send a stack of it down, just slip a bit in an envolope together with a couple of nibs (thats if bucks still use nibs and blotting paper)\nWell dear I will close on this sheet so give my love to your Mother, Rene, and Tim. I hope you mother is looking after you and seeing that you don’t catch any more colds. Goodnight Kath look after yourself. Your everlasting love\nBern\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nGnr B Shepherd\nSignal Training Wing\nCATC\nFort Staddon\nPlymstock\nPlymouth\nDevon\n\nDearest,\nThanks for your letter that you wrote Saturday afternoon. I got it on Monday afternoon. You are quite right, we do have enough work to pass the time away, infact I’ve enough ‘evening work’ now to last me a couple of whole days and it keeps mounting up every day! Up till now I’ve 15 pages of notes and they have all got to be rewritten in another note book. That besides learning morse on the buzzer, lamp, and flag, All in our spare time! Yes, its a good job we have a cinema here as there is little time for going into Plymouth. There is a film on tonight and \"How green is my Valley\" tomorrow which I shall make time to go and see. It gives us a bit of a break.\nLast night I played football for the Signals against the searchlights. We lost 4-2 but I believe if we practised a bit we would wipe them off the field as this was our first game, whilst the searchlights have been playing quite a while. Also, owing to an axident, one of our players had to drop out at the end.\nI hope you have got to like your coat better now than you did when you wrote. I expect its a case of getting used to it. Its bound to look nice on you anyway darling.\nI’m glad that my photo has come out O.K. I didn’t think it would, as I wasn’t realy ready for it. If, as you say, it has come out alright my face must like the camera.\nI had a letter from home today and says that Frank rolled up there about half an hour after we had left on Wednesday. I have now got his new address at Chatham.\nI got my knife and fork back that I left in the barrack room. One of the chaps spotted it and kept them until I went back last Wednesday. It was a bit of luck he spotted them.\nI am now going to do a bit of my ‘home work’ darling so I will say bye-bye for a while. I’m sorry the letter is short but I’m sure you will understand. Goodnight dear I’ll write again as soon as I can. \nGive my love to all at No 59.\nEver yours\nBern\nX\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nGnr B Shepherd\nSignal Training Wing\nFort Staddon\nPlymstock\nPlymouth\nDevon\n\nDarling,\nAs much as I hate it I’m afraid I have to start my letter in the usual style. I’m sorry I havent written before dear. I’m not asking you to forgive me as I know you would but instead just tell me off as much as you like.\nIm have got quite a pile of your letters to answer, its good of you to write to me so much since I appear to be neglect you. It not that darling its a h--- of a job to find time to write. \nSorry to hear that you are having quite a taste of fog. Those things are unheard of in theese parts. Its very often rather misty so that you can’t see the distant hills but as a while its grand weather for the time of year. I hope you’ve chased that cold away by this time. Those fogs are one of the worse things for colds etc so forgoodness sake look after yourself.\nBristows brother must be raving mad, I think. Getting merried when hes not as old as I am, hes also in the army and during a war. He must be tipsy. Is he on his 7 days leave next week then? Is Bristows brother still at the I.O.W. or has he done his 6 weeks yet? I imagine it should be about up by now.\nAnyway, you should be ashamed of yourself wasting paper on confetti!\nSo Ella is up to the same trick as she was six weeks ago. She ate something that didn’t agree with her and magnified it until she was half dead (in theory). I strikes me that everybodies boy friends are coming home this week except me.\n\"What is Heliograph?\" I thought I gave a discription of it quite a while ago but evidently I didn’t, so here goes. I suppose that you have at some time or other got a mirror and flashed the reflection of the sun into someones eyes. Well, this is exactly the same principle. A mirror about 4\" diameter is fixed onto a stand and there are certain gagets on this mirror to adjust it so that tis reflection will fall onto the required spot to signal to. At the back of the mirror up and down sa you press on it and release it. Therefore, if the mirror is alowed to drop down it takes the reflection off of the place you are signaling to,m and when it comes up it brings the reflection on again, subciquently morse code can be sent.\nIts claimed that in the east (where this is mostly used) it can be seen at 70 to 90 miles on a clear day.\nAnd if you can understand that you’re a marvel.\nWe are going to have a radio on our room soon, as they have them in the store. We asked one of our offices if he thought he could get one for us and he applied to the Soldiers Welfare fund or something. They sent 3 sets down but none of them would work so the signal instructors got busy and repaired them. I shall know all the songs when we get it. Anyway, I know that one \"You are always in my heart\" and you always will be darling.\nThere was a ensa consert here on friday (the day I was going to write to you) and I quite enjoyed it. There was 2 chaps (a comedian and an accordianist and 3 girls (pianist, dancer and Singer, and a sort of dancer and comedian combined.) Yesterday we saw ‘the glass Key’ and Whispering ghosts it the odean. Both were pretty good, did you see them?\nThe church parade today was pretty jolly to what it usualy is as we were not inspected at all. A seargent gave us rookies a look over and the officer didn’t inspect us at all. The other week we had a terrible officer (we don’t call him terrible) on church parade and he stood in front of everyone until he found something wrong with him. He’ll have to mind his Ps and Qs if he goes out to the front. It was a great treat to hear the church bells ringing as we went in.\nIt made me wonder how long they will remain motionless again untill that great day when peace is signed. It gave me quite a thrill today hearing those bells so goodnes knows what it will be like then. I shall land up in a mental home!\nI wonder what you are doing at this moment Kath. Although your all those miles away I can’t seem to realize that somehow. I’m laying full out on this bed (upside down with my feet on the pillow) right against a big coke fire glowing white hot. My bed is against the fire as I’m second from the end. There are five of the boys in bed just now and another by the fire with me. The rest have gone for a walk. Its 3.30 (PM)\nYou know that I once said that pinching was unknown in this place - well, it isn’t. For about a fortnight now someone has swiped a pair of bonoculars from a pal of mines kit bag. I was the only person who knew he had it (or so we thought) as we went out together one sunday and watched the boats coming in. He didn’t shout about them as they aren a jolly good pair. Anyway, one day the lock was broken and they were removed from his kit bag. He told me about it and I knew darn well he put them back. So he told me to keep quiet and then reported it. Our officer brought in the police who went round all the pawnbrokes etc. They found it and the pawnbroker had a perfect description of one of our chaps (Ernie). The RSM sent for Ernie who has not been seen since. When we heard about it ever one went silent for about 5 minutes. He was one of the best chaps you could ever meet and a couple of the chaps in our room have known him for over 2 years and they can’t understand it. The sarg said that he has a big army debt and only gets 6/- a week.\nWell dear I will shut up shop now and write some more letters. I’ll write to mum at leased. So cheerio darling\nWith Everlasting Love\nBern\n"

I’m sorry I havent written before but I have not had time. I havent even had enough time to spend much money, infact I’m saving quite a bit down here now. I’m afraid I shall be unable to write so many letters as I did before as this coarse is pretty stiff and I nead every minute that I can spare. I mean to pass this if I can. I’m sorry but I’m sure you will understand dear and remember that its only for 3 months. When the 3 months is up you will have to admit that it hasn’t been long. This is all so interesting here that the days go by like wildfire to me.\nSorry I spelt your name wrong but it was only one lettre, just you wait till I start putting \"Carpenter\". By the time this lot is over I shan’t be able to write atall except morse. I’ll be writing in a series of dots and dashes.\nMum wrote today and she seemed disappointed with the photo. She said the photo was alright but expected me to have a full length done and at postcard size. I’m afraid both of theese were impossible dear as that was the only size he had but next time you can arrange a date for that Bodger bloke. I’ll have a decent one done then.\nThere isn’t much news to say about this place as I havent been out and we have just been working on the morse, semephore, morse lamp and morse flag. The P.T. is OK here as we play football all the time. That film \"How Green is my Valley\" was posponed on Wednesday and instead had \"Ride ‘em cowboy\". The other is comming down later.\nWell darling I must now get on with my notes or I shall be getting behind. Please excuse the scribble as time is precious, I shall be writing again as soon as I can get a minute to spare but don’t look forward to one every other day incase I disappoint you.\nGoodnight darling\never Yours\nBern\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nGnr B Shepherd\nSignal Training Wing\nCATC\nFort Staddon\nPlymstock\nPlymouth\nDevon\n\nDearest,\nThanks for Thursdays letter dear. \nDon’t worry about my writing, I shall always write whenever I can but even if I didn’t write for a month you;ve no reason to think that I’ve forgotten you. You’re ever in my mind like a carving in stone. Its impossible to forget you, even more so while I’m miles away like this. I didn’t see that film (I believe I told you in my last letter, didn’t I?) \"Yes, you did\" \"did I, thanks very much I shan’t tell you again then\"\nSorry if I have not said much about the mansion I now live in. Its only a small fort which, until a couple of years ago, was a desolate ruin but has been patched up and is now jolly good. All the rooms, except the tin huts put up recently, are set into the walls of the place with passage ways running through the walls connecting the rooms. Theese passages remind you of the tower on London every time you walk thro’ them. The barrack rooms themselves are very light as they are all glass one end. This is how they are built:-\n[drawing]\nWe have to go outside of the fort for our food as the cookhouse is in a field outside. Running underneath this place are dungeons with chains still hanging on the walls where the prisoners were chained. I should say that there are about 200 here, although its hard to say as you don’t see them all at once. The food here isn’t so good. The breakfast and dinner are pretty good but the tea is poor and we get no supper at all. On the weekends we have tea early at 4.30 and there is nothing more until 7.30 the next morning. The NAAFI here is terrible. All they sell is tea (or rather washing up water) and cakes (and very often no variety at all) so its not much if you go there of an evening. The nearest place you can get anything is a fish and chip shop 20 mins walk away which we often visit.\nI think you have the wrong impression of the army darling. It doesn’t go round, its pals stuff pinching every thing that it can find. From what little expearience I have had it seems to be the oposite. I havent known of anything being pinched from anybody since I joined except when its been left outside in the wash place or somewhere like that, where anyone can get it.\nI’m afraid I’ve started smoking again. On this course we are sitting down all day and of an evening for a couple of three hours puzzling our brains and a fag helps to keep you up to it. After we have finished we’ve got writers cramp and the head is whirling round.\nDid you get your weeks money or the holidays? If so mum should be recieving one soon.\nI am now going to write to mum now, I wrote to dad just now as he wont be coming home for a month or two, so I will close now.\nI wont say the usual goodnight as its afternoon and I supose you are either at No 59 or out, although the weather here isn’t to good. Its very misty at the moment. This place is pretty high and low clouds often cover it. When we get into plymouth its generaly much better and certainly alot warmer.\nSo cheerio darling\nAlways yours\nBern\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nGnr B Shepherd\nSignal Training Wing\nCATC\nFort Staddon\nPlymstock\nPlymouth\nDevon\n\nDarling,\nBy the looks of it, it seems that I don’t know my own address yet. I was going to put 12th P.T.C. at first but just stopped myself intime. Thanks very much for your letter darling I’m finding a bit of time to write than I expected altho I don’t expect one every other day just incase I can;t manage it sometimes. We have just got paid and we have a bit of time to spare before diner so I’m starting now and will finish it off tonight.\nThe weather here has been pretty rotten lately, a very strong wind and a drissle of rain which is jolly uncomfortable standing in the middle of a field, either swinging a flag about or reading messages sent over by the instructors. It’ll be a devil when it realy gets cold.\nSome of the letters that leave here are censored the same as the Citadel. One chap has had one censored since he has been here.\nA chap came in just now and said that a chap next door pegged out a while ago. I know him quite well as he used to help in the cook house and only today he served us with out meat. After dinner he came back and laid on his bed in his barrack room saying that he didn’t feel well. He then had a fit and died before the ambulance could arrive.\nI’m writing home for one of those photos from mum if she still has one to spare as I want to find out for myself what it is like for dad says in a letter to me that \"I look as tho’ I’m either shy or in love\" and adds \"I expect its love\". What is the matter with this bluepencil photo?\nI expect I shall go to Plymouth tomorrow and see a film or something. It will break the spell of this blinkin’ place. Its a pity that its not summer now as we wouldn’t have to go to the cenima for a break. Its lovely country round about and during good weather it would be a fine camp to be in but in weather like we have now its awful.\nBy the way, as its getting dark of a night now you had better not go round my place. Its rather dismall walk round there isn’t it when you’re on your own? I meant to have told you before but it slipped my memory until tonight. You can go round one weekend if you want to.\nI’m afraid my information (can’t spell it) is running out now darling altho I want to fill up this page somehow as its a waist of paper if I don’t. Look after yourself darling wont you? I’m counting the weeks off to when I shall be with you again. We are leaving here (if we pass) on 31st Dec and going to fort Stanford about 2 miles away from there we are sent on leave and also posted from there when we return.\nWell darling I will close now so give my love to Irene and your Mother and Tim. Goodnight Kath and may God answer all my prayers\nYours ever\nBern\nx x\n x x\n x\n x x\nx x\n"

I’m sorry I didn’t write yesterday but we don’t get much time. Tonight I want to write two letters, have an hour and a halfs practice in the buzzer room, have a bath and get all todays notes written up. Its 6.00 clock now, so you can see how much time I have especialy when I say that it will take me about 1 ½ hrs to do my notes. Every night except Friday, Sat & Sun the seargent gives us an hour & ½ practice on the buzzer to help us a bit. I’m writing on the other side of the sheets now as I’ve a fountain pen as you may have noticed. When I get all my notes up to date it will be a great help as I will then write my notes straight into the book (I hope) Now to start your letters.\nI recond when I come up Bucks next, old Lee will be in his glory showing off his knowledge. (I’ve just come back from morse reading) it made me laugh when you said \"you know the alphabet is only a matter of practise\". Half of the notes that we have taken so far are on morse, all different methods etc. Sorry I disappointed you on Saturday, not recieving a letter from me but I just couldn’t find time. Anyway, I’m making time tonight.\nYou had quite a bit of enjoyment in the pictures I should think. I bet theres been some cracks about it anyway.\nI suppose I should feel proud to have CGT (the old censored) asking about me. I hope you told him I was broke and was in great need of some cash.\nThanks very much for the blotting paper, I’ll write again when I want some more, altho’ I shall not use so much with this pen as it dries quickly.\nWe have a film here tomorrow night. Ask a policeman and some other film. I expect I shall go if my notes are not too far behind by that time.\nI’m sorry darling but I must close now and try and write again Friday altho I don’t promise. Its no waste of time writing to you darling and I certainly can’t forget you so you can be sure I shall write as often as I can. I can realize it is very difficult to think of anything to write about and I think its very unfair that you write to me four or more times a week and I only once or twice. Please forgive me, my dear, it wont be for long.\nGoodnight darling\nEver yours\nBern xxxxxxxxx\nP.S. -- .. … … -.-./.- .-. .--. . -. - . .-.\n\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nGnr B Shepherd\nSignal Training Wg\nCATC\nFort Staddon\nPlymstock\nPlymouth\nDevon\n\nDarling,\nWhen I started reading your letter \"Something terrible has happened\" I wondered what ever was the matter. I thought you had broke your neck or something. I bet you’re sore about no afternoon tea, never mind - we have ½ an hours break in the morning and knocks off at 5 o’clock so that makes up for it, doesn’t it? (or does it)\nIs it that song \"I fell in love with a sailor, who came and stole my heart away\"? If it isn’t that one I’ve never heard of it. Whats the reason for this gag?\nSorry I scored a direct hit with the carpenter stunt so lets drop it before you retaliate. It makes my knees knock to of it. I like the Bernard Charles Shepherd, I believe you forgot Gunner, it would have make it a bit longer.\nThe reason I got mum to get a fountain pen was because I can now write my notes straight into my note book while we are at the lectures. You can’t very well take a bottle of ink arround everywhere.\nIts been raining here for a week now and bitter cold and terrific winds as usual. It will be a jolly good job when we are allowed fires so that we can thaw out. I believe we shall have them on Nov 1.\nIt just about cools you down when you’re standing in a field or on top of the wall waving a flag or reading messages. We were certainly lucky with our 7 days darling next time the weather wont be so good but I’m looking forward to it twice as much as I was last time and thats saying something. I never realised how much I was going to enjoy those 7 days of heaven. Another month and I shall be thinking about it, and the time will soon slip by then. Who said you was being selfish? If you are being selfish, so am I, and so are many more in England. We seem to be making progress in the east now and if it goes on it will shorten the war in leaps and bounds so it may not be so far away as we imagine. Remember the last war finished when no one expected it.\nI don’t know whether reads sence but there is a chap who has his sax here now and is playing it. He can play it OK too. Its rather awkward writing at the same time .\nWell dear I can’t think of anything else, sorry I didn’t write yesterday but I was busy mending. Its the first time I’ve ever done any darning. I had 3 socks to do and I’ve worn one of them today and it hasn’t gone yet. I also mended my denims and wrote two letters then went on to Devonport for an outing. On Saturday we went to Plymouth and saw the RAs play against the Marines at footer. We bear them up proper 6-1. One of the Signal Wing was playing. After that we waited for Eric (one that played) and visited the YMCA and then the Pictures. We had to come back by train as the ferry stops so early now.\nWell, as I’ve already said, I can’t think of any more altho if I started talking about nothing I expect I could fill another side but it would be a waste of paper and I want to get some bed. Goodnight darling sleep well.\nYours,\nBern\nxx xxxx / xxx xxx xxx / x xxx x / x / x x x xxx / x / x xxx x /\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nGnr B Shepherd\nSignal Training Wing\nCATC\nFort Staddon\nPlymstock\nPlymouth\n\nDearest Kath,\nI’m writing this letter now at 4.30 as we knocked off at quarter past. The weather has been so terrible today that we could not do flag work. We would have been soaked if we had as it came down in bucket fulls and everywhere is ankle deep with mud. Therefore we were 2 periods ahead today and we finished actually at 3-30 but then cleared up the lecture rooms as some Big Pot is coming round to inspect them tomorrow. I just thought about you working till 5-30. We always K.O. at 5-00.\nThanks very much for Mondays letter. How did you get on about the afternoon tea? Poor Old Warren, I don’t envy his job of trying to keep you girls in order. Hes certainly got his hands full!\nDid you go round to my mothers Tuesday? Did she seem alright? I’m rather worried about her as she has been run down for quite a while and I think she is trying to work to hard. She has been to the doctors and got some jollop but it hasn’t done her any good. He is giving her injections now. \nWe have been on telephone work today with the Field telephones. It sounds simple to phone but the army way is different. There are different proceedures and things to say and not to say and secrete signs & codes etc.We have to learn all about the phone in case it goes wrong too. I can’t read 6 words a minute on the buzzer. We have to read 12 before we pass out. I can do 4 all right but with 6 I miss too many of the letters to make sence. One of the chaps can read 10 as he was in the Signals in the home guard. Its a big help to him. Its funny but some days you can read pretty fair and the next, your a wash out. Its the same with everybody.\nThe sun shone for quite a while yesterday so we had the Helios out. Its quite interesting mucking about with theese. They are mirrors fixed on a stand which can send messages by flashing the sun rays on to the distant station. Its a smart way that the mirror is set so that the ray is brought onto the station. During clear weather it can be seen 70 miles away and its only a small mirror about 6\" across.\nWe had a couple of Morse lamps out on Tuesday night in the barrack room. One of the lamps in one corner and one in the other and we sent messages and code signs etc to and from. We had quite an enjoyable time and were learning at the same time. I just read through this letter to give me inspiration, and I don’t seem to be writing a very good letter but I suppose you will be able to puzzle it out. I bet you have a job sometimes when I’m in a hurry! Still, never mind, only another 50 years and this game of soldiers will be over.\nWell, my brain isn’t capable of thinking anything else to write so I’ll have to stop. You can’t very well write a letter when there is nought to speak about. Bye bye darling.\nI’m always thinking of you (except when I’m asleep, I don’t know if I do then) Give my love to Mum, Rene, Tim, and also a sweet little girl by the name Kath a big kiss from me.\nGoodnight dear\nBern\nP.S. …-. .-.-.\n.-- …. .- - / -.. --- / -.-- --- ..- / - …. .. -. -.- ?\n.-.-.\n"

Sorry to hear that you now only get ¼ of an hr for your tea. I can imagine old Warren making you click in and out just to make sure you don’t come in late. I can hear him say \"Now then Miss Joyner, you’ve had 17 minutes I’ll deduct it off your pay!\"\nI believe that word in Morse started with ..-. (F) instead of C, making FOREVER. Anyway, whether I put C or F, I still meant the same thing.\nFrank certainly is a lucky blighter. Getting home every other night is just about my idea of a good place for barracks. I wouldn’t mind (in fact I’d be realy enjoying myself) if I could see you every other day darling. Still we can’t grumble, there are thousands worse off us.\nI wouldn’t like to count the times I’ve thought about comming home for good. Although it seems an imposibility, it will come true as sure as I’m writing to you now. Whether its sooner or later its worth while waiting for and even if its two years its not so very long and when we look back at this parting afterwards and then look forward it wont seem but a flea bite. Remember it was the war that brought us together. So for the present we will just look to January and forget all. For goodness sake don’t let a little row we had last time worry you. I didn’t forgive you as it was my fault and therefore you should have forgiven me. I hadn’t thought anything more about it dear until you wrote. So, garling, please forget it, if it was your fault I’ve forgiven you thousands of times and if it were mine, I’m sorry. I don’t suppose it will be the last time that we will quarrel over some little thing but never mind we shall always make it up, so stop worrying before we have another row.\nI have written quite a lot so far and said nothing so I think its about time I started. The weather here is alot better today and the sun is shining, and I am going out when I’ve finished this letter as I have sticking indoors. We are allowed fires from today but it is so mild that we havent lit it. Saving the coal for the evenings when it turns a bit nippy. For the last couple of days it has been quite nice for the time of the year and the dump we are in.\nYesterday we went and saw the boys play the pay corps. Altho they won 2-1 the aught to have been shot. They couldn’t play football to save their life and nor could the pay corps. There were only two players on our side, Ginger and the chap in our room (he scored both goals) The others just seemed to boot it when it got near them. It was a jolly good job we didn’t pay a tanner to see them or we should have moaned.\nWe went to the pictures after and saw Bugle Calls. We were going to see either Gold Rush or the Young Mr Pitt but didn’t fancy waiting.\nI can’t think of any more to write just now and one of the boys is waiting for me to have a snoop around so I will close now darling.\nSo Cheerio\nYour Bern\nXxxxxxxx x100000\nPS Sorry Kath but I quite agree with dad about the photo though its passable I supose (for the salvage dump)\n"

Its Wales and post it sunday night and it arrives here monday morning but from Ilford I don’t get it until Tuesday dinner time.\nYes we have to learn telephones alright. There are 3 types we use - how to mend them and fix them up. We are also learning a portable switchboard. Its much the same as a civy one but it folds up into a box. We have been on it this morning as a matter of fact. The Switchboard is in the corner of a room and portable telephones on tables round the sides. One takes the switchboard and the others keeps ringing each other. they are trying to teach us too much if you ask me, I jolly well know that my grey matter wont stand it and if I pass this stunt it will be a fluke. Still, if I don’t pass I don’t and thats that!\nGlad you have some work to keep you occupied. It will make the time go quicker (or would you rather not have any) I have a bit more time of an evening now that I write my notes straight in. Yesterday was the first time we had fires. We had an hours morse practice last night then had a couple of signaling lamps in the barrack room, signalling with them for 1 hour or so. It was about eight then so I said ‘hang it’ to Notes or letters and we all got round the fire with a few songs and jokes. We swiped some bread and Marg from tea and made toast. One chap had a whole chicken send down to him which he warmed up and shared so we had toast and chicken. The sarg came in during the evening and joined us. I said he can quite understand what it will be like at christmas!\nIt doesn’t worry me if Burnie comes home by train. I wouldn’t care if the King of England comes home with you. You can tell old Fryface from me what she is. I shan’t put it in this letter as I never used bad language in front of a lady yet and I don’t start now. I don’t mind because you’re mine for ever, and I know you darling.\nI thought you learnt morse. Those …-. And .-.-. Are always sent at the beginning and end of a message. …-. Is VE run together meaning I have a message for you and .-.-. is AR run together meaning end of transmittion. There are 30 or 40 of theese sort of things, a couple of letters run together meaning something else. Theres desimal points, comas, full stops, brackets, strokes and a lot of messages that are often used when things go wrong etc. Its no morse code of my own.\nOur signal wing of 14 has depreciated to 10 now as one as been sent back to the guns and 2 more have gone back to the next squad that is coming in on Thursday. Another is in hospital. One of the other cahps is excused all outside work as he is suffering from his chest but he has done signal work before so he may be able to keep up with us until he recovers. There are quite a few in our squad who have done signals of some discription before. That chap is playing ‘Yours’ now, he as been playing all the evening. Now hes playing \"because I love you\" do you know it? I keep stopping this letter now and again to help them sing.\nI shall have to write to Burnie some time as I havent written since I’ve been back. I wrote to Frank last week.\nGive my love to all at No 59. Well darling I will close now and make a bit of toast.\nGoodnight dearest, look after yourself for me\nYours Everlasting\nBern\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nGnr B Shepherd\nSignal Training Wing\nCATC\nFort Staddon\nPlymstock\nPlymouth\nDevon\n\nDearest,\nI’m sorry that I’ve been so long writing darling as it seems ages since I wrote last. I believe it was 4 or 5 days ago. Anyway. I’ve been rather busy, I meant to have written on thursday but there were films on. Will Fife in ‘Aud bob’ and a micky mouse. Friday I went to a meeting and also swotted up as we had a test on Saturday. I came 4th in it (The rest must have been asleep.) Yesterday we went to the Gaumont and saw Eagle Squadron. Anyway, I’ll make up for it now with a long letter if the boys will let me.\nThe weather is realy grand today for the time of year. The sun is shining and it doesn’t seem a bit cold. I believe a lot of it is due to the fact that we get used to it being out in the open most of the time. It was quite hot coming home last night and that was about 11.30. Mind you its all uphill.\nNo, I didn’t mean the Signal Wing when when I spoke about ‘the boys’ in footer. They were The 71st RA, We don’t play much now as it gets so dark of an evening and we have other things to do than play footer on our afternoon off. Heres one that wouldn’t anyway. I expect the blackout is alot later than yours up in London. Altho its about 6.30. It doesn’t give you anytime after tea.\nYou made me laugh ‘old bill a coalman. He works in the docks in the building line. I don’t quite know what he does. Yes, it is Clark.\nI can’t understand the ‘Holland’.\nBy the way, that \"Only you\". I was going to ask you where it originated from in my last letter but, having a memory like a tea strainer without a bottom in it, I forgot. You don’t have to tell me now though as I heard it on the wireless on Friday. I’ll have to learn that tune. Its a second ‘Yours’ isn’t it?\nI jolly well know I shan’t learn everything on this course and not will any one else unless they have a couple of brains shoved in together. Thats why they’ve issued us with a note book and have weekly inspections of it. The signallers Bible’ is what they call it as he is always refering to it.\nI have not written to Burnie yet but I may write later today. I’m up to my neck in letters that I should write but I’m not writing them all today as I’d be getting writers cramp. I recond I’ve done more writing this last month than I used to do in 3 months working at Bucks.\nI expect Burnie will come in one day and say he has his papers when everybody has forgotten all about it, just the same as I did. I shall never forget that day and I didn’t realy know how I felt. I was heated up with excitement of going but there was also that awful dread of leaving you mixed with it. Still, this war wont be long now before its over, then goodbye to all theese misty days.\nDo you know, I believe your worrying about Burnie travelling with you. Well, take it from me, I’m not. I don’t care a hang what bucks or anybody else say. If they’re out to try and make me jealous they have another think comming, evidently the don’t know me. Has old Fryface started her tales again?\nWhat do you think of the war now? It certainly looks a bit brighter now than it has done before. I bet old jerry has a pain in the neck now that he can’t sure with ointment. It proves they ain’t unbeatable anyway.\nGoodness knows what to buy mum for Christmas. I hadn’t given it a thought realy as it seems a while off yet. Realy I hadn’t thought about buying any presents at all owing to a little matter of doe. I jolly well know I shan’t have much. But still, there is plenty of time before then so why worry now.\nI can read 8 words a minute on morse sometimes although it all depends on how I feel. The semaphore is what gives me most trouble now as we don’t get more than 2 periods on it a week and the speed he sends it out now is so quick that you have to be pretty slick to get it down as the other chap is calling it out. Bombarder Brack, one of our instructors, is a marvel with Flags. On semephore it doesn’t matter how fast he goes, his angles are always perfect and he can keep it up for a dickens of a time. I’ve never known him to make a mistake either. Its just the same on Morse Flag, every thing properly in time. I’ve seen quite a lot of other bombarders and Sargs on flag but not one can touch him.\nHaving nothing else to say I stopped and had a smoke hoping something would enter my block and talking to one of my mates he showed me a letter that he had just written to his wife. He writes smaller than I do and he had written 8 pages. They were not so big as theese and he only wrote on one side but he must have had a load of tripe in it as he wouldn’t be able to find all that to say I’m sure. He has a daughter 3 months old. He was called up a couple of years ago but got his release as he is a carpenter, on vital work. Half of the chaps here are carpenters all called back again from reserve the same as him. They went about working with the demolition squads all over the country.\nGive my love to your Mother, Rene, and Tim.\nI hate to stop writing to you darling as it almost seems as if I’m speaking to you right here. If only I was home with you now.\nCheerio sweet\nFrom one so near and yet to far\nBern\nXxxxxxxx\n"

Sorry to disappoint you yesterday when you didn’t reciever a letter from me. I can’t imagine you blaming everybody. Still, never mind, I expect you got today.\nThat boy friend of Margaret. Is that one that wasn’t too fond of writing? I bet shes almost gone mad. Remember in the good old days when she was going home for the holidays? She nearly went nuts. Anyway dear next week, when he has gone back, we will still have ours to look forward to.\nBurtontripe has soon made up her mind, hasn’t she? The last I knew she was holding Bristows brother under her thumb. Its not him, is it? Is she leaving Bucks? By the looks of it, this sheet appears to be exam papers with all its questions. I can see your answer being full of ‘No Yes Yes No’. I’ve just realised that I havnt filled the other side of the other sheet but will go back to that when I’ve filled both sides of this one.\nWhats the matter with Pascoe now. I always thought you two were dead enemys. You eat those grapes yourself dear don’t send them to me, I’m not that made on them. You’ll enjoy them I know.\nGetting told off for talking again, eh? You’ll wear your tonge out one of theese days.\nYou say Ella had food poisoning. Was it realy poisoning or just a fake as I did the same thing some time ago, I can’t remember whether it was at Bucks or not.\nI’ve now finished answering your letter so I’ve now got to thing of something out of my own head. Its a bit of a puzzle isn’t it?\nI’ll start off telling you what we had today. First period (8.30 - 9-15) was Morse flag reading. We go outside of the fort for this and the bombarder stands on the wall signalling. He used to send messages out of the paper. Just bits of the news but now he just sends off letters as some of the chaps were guessing at the words if the missed them. I’d rather have them in code myself as you don’t worry about what word it is.\nAfter Morse Flag we had P.T. football we had against the new signal wing that has just come here. We won 2-1 although we should have got 10 but they all formed into backs when they found we were better than them. We couldn’t get near the blinking goal.\nPlease excuse me a moment while I eat a baked spud. Its a pitty I havent any salt.\nVery nice.\nWe were on the switchboard then until 10.45 Break 11015, Then started on another switchboard which is totally different to the other. We took all the notes of it today (or rather some of them) we didn’t do any practical work on it. After that which lasted 2 periods there was Heliograph and then buzzer reading. We are now doing 10 words a minute (or suposed to be)\nThe weather hasn’t been too bad here for about a fortnight now. Last night it was a nice evening so we went for a walk, we started at 6.30 and didn’t arrive back until a quarter to eleven and we were walking fast all the way. We covered miles singing all the way, we don’t know exactly where we went and hardly saw a sole on the way but I slept like a log last night. I didn’t wake till 10 past 7.\nWell darling I must close now as I want to write at least one more letter tonight before bed and its 09.00 now.\nGoodnight Kath I’m always thinking of you\nYours for ever\nBern\n"

Shepherd\nSignals\nFort Staddon\nPlymstock\nPlymouth\n\nSunday\n\nDearest,\nThank you for your letter dear.\nI’m sitting right against a glorious fire that is packed to the chimney with glowing coke as I’m writing this in grand style.\nWe have been made to do inline picked now which is a sort of ARP and defence combined, and we are on every other day so that we have to stay in on these alternative nights. Until now only Gunners and Searchlight chaps have been doing it but now they have bagged us for it.\nLuckily we’re only here another fortnight. We are off Christmas day but am on xmas eve and boxing day so it aint too good.\nWe have our exams next Wednesday and Thursday and our reading classification on the Monday following so we are pretty busy now swotting up for it. I expect I shall pass with a bit of luck but I’m very shaky on the reading. Still, I should do it if I’m realy on form Monday week. \nI don’t exactly know when I shall have my leave (if I pass) but we are moving from here to the posting depot on Thursday I think, and that would mean that 10 to 1 we should have leave on Friday. This would bring in two weekends as you said and it will be dandy if its true!\nJust imagine it dear; another fortnight and I shall be with you again.\nIts been a couple of hours since I wrote that last word as I laid my head down and dozed off. I was woken at tea time by being slung out of bed.\nThere are terrific winds here again and yesterday as we were walking past a barrage balloon just outside of the fort, the stakes were pulled out and the balloon split clean in half and stretched out across the road about 20 feet away from us. It all happened in a matter of seconds.\nWe saw a couple of films at the Gaumont yesterday that were exactly the same type and story. I can’t remember the names now but they were nothing to shout about. It was more or less all love and got boring in the middle. Still it made a break.\nRemember I put on the bottom of my last letter about having egg for supper. One of the chaps father owns a farm and he had a couple of dozen sent down.\nWell darling I must close now. I’ve 3 more letters to write tonight if possible so if I only scribble a small note off to you next week I know you’ll forgive me but I must do quite alot of swotting. It will be worth it so that I can be home in a fortnight. \nOn my last leave I saw 20 make up a program for the next one but it will be much better if we go on as we did the last time. There wont be Mr Pike home this time.\nGood night darling,\nYours,\nBern.\n\n"

I’m sorry I again disappointed you by not writing dear but I can generally find more time to write early in the week but it gets a bit more difficult towards the end. Yes, when I’ve finished this course I hope I shall have a bit more time to myself and it should only be another 6 weeks if I pass out OK.\nI don’t envy Renes journey up to manchester. It will be rather cold on the trains. I wouldn’t mind a little journey to Paddington just now, though.\nYes, I remember Joan McArthy alright. Does she live anywhere near then?\nWhats the matter with your writing? Ever since I joined the army I can’t remember ever being unable to read a word of any of your letters darling. I bet its not scribbled off so much as some of mine.\nI told you some weeks ago now to go round to mums of an evening as its so dark now and I can imagine how you feel going back.\nDon’t care if your letters are Green, black, or sky blue pink, they will always be red (read)\nMy father got home last week end for the first time and is comming home this weekend too but he doesn’t think he will be able to get home any more for quite a while, still he is luckier than I am as I shall not see you darling till after Christmas.\nIts been a lovely sunny day today but its been pretty cold. This morning when when I went out on P.T. the frost was laying on the grass like snow. We had a game of footbnall and soon got warmed up. It was rotten this afternoon though as we were laying out in the fields for a hour and a half waiting of messages to be signaled to us. We got frozen stiff. When we came back we thought we’d get a nice hot cup of tea to warm us up as it was tea time. Dashed if the tea wasn’t half cold! Thats not all, when we came out we had to stay outside for about 10 minutes as they were mounting the guard!\nWe had one of the best teas we have had here tonight. Fried fish and a cake. Both of theese are scarce at this dump.\nOur wireless set is going strong now. I bet it will be a bit of a nuisance sometimes when we are trying to concentrate. Still, it makes the place a bit more homely.\nWe are having some tests on thursday. They are official and add to your passing out.\nI wrote to Burnie yesterday as I expect you have, or will, hear about. Its been about 3 months now since he registered hasn’t it? I expect thats because be gone for the airforce. With a bit of luck the war will be over before he is fully trained. I’ve never seen him in his ATC uniform but I can imagine him with his wings up. He is going in for flying duties isn’t he. Something at the back of my mind has just told me that he going in the Navy or am I getting mixed up. I know that in his last letter (dated Sept) that I was reading yesterday it said definatly airforce but I’ve thrown that in the fire.\nWell darling I will close now as I’ve very little to day. Give my love to your mother, Rene, and Tim. Goodnight darling\nYours everlasting\nBern\n"

I’m glad you are now having fires at Bilbao, ofcourse you understand that if they have too many fires the firm may go broke.\nI do remember going to wanstead with you for the first time. We came back via the rustic bridge. We sang ‘Yours’ didn’t we?\nI’ve just had a nice hot bath so now I’ll try and give you all the dope since I wrote last.\nThe weather has got a bit colder down here now, although we have had no rain or fog etc. We now wear our overcoats when going out in the fields. Our officer captain Woods must have felt good tempered the other day when he said we could wear them. Hes a very nice chap, nobody likes him! I bet if they put him up as a target at a rifle range no one would miss. If he turns sideways all you can see is his moustash (Hes so thin we call him handlebars. Our other officer, Riley, is one of the best. Hes just the opposite to old Woods. He is only 23 and good looking and smart. Even in battledress he stands out a mile with the other officers.\nI feel a bit more bucked about this course now. We had a part of our ‘mid term’ exam yesterday which consisted of all the instruments which we’ve done so far and dashed if I didn’t come out top with fill marks, 35 out of 35. Next to me was 33. Anyway, everybody passed. On Monday we have out written test but I don’t think I shall do as well with that.\nGoodness knows what is the batter with me tonight but I’ve suddenly come to a full stop, its the first time thats happened on the first page, anyhow I’m not finishing yet even if I fill the next page up with kisses. \nTommy Handly is on the wireless now. I myself don’t think much of him, hes too much of the same thing.\nThere was a film here yesterday. ‘The man who could work miricles’ Its a donkeys old picture and wasn’t much cop. You can tell by the title that it was a true story. Then they always have a micky mouse to finish off.\nThe was news is still looking up darling and every time I hear the news it makes me think of the time when the church bells ring out the victory peel. That will be the day. Everyone will go mad. Just imagine the day when I come home for good. It doesn’t seem possible but it will come one day. But just now I’m thinking of the seven days which wont be long now as I’ve got through half of my course.\nI don’t think there is anything else just now, deear, so give my love to all at home. Goodnight\nYours everlasting\nBern\n"

There certainly is a bit of different between the time of our two call ups after our medical.\nI shouldn’t fancy being a prisoner in Japan - the look of a jap makes me feel sick, I’d like to line ‘em up against the wall and have a bren gun practice. It must have been a releif to that chaps wife anyway. The same thing happened to a pall of mines brother at the I.O.W.\nIts no use moaning because I’m away darling we’ll have to just grin and bear it.\nSo you’ve started sneaking out in the morning again have you? You girls make me laugh. Girls ain’t satisfied with anything. If they gave you from 9 till 4.30 off you’d moan if they didn’t give you a rise with it. I can guess why he has got that new girl in, hes going to give you the sack. I don’t suppose that would worry you much anyway. Yes, men do crazy thinks, still if men had got some sence all the men connected with marriage ceremonies (how do you spell it) would be out of a job!\nI remember Usines OK. Don’t blame me if its in a mess as I cleared everything up. Mind you it took months. I wouldn’t mind being there to help you either.\nThere is no rows about who or what we have on the wireless as the bluepencil thing konked out this morning. Still, we are beginning our wireless lectures next week so we will be pulling it to pieces. (Some hopes)\nWe have our last test tomorrow morning first thing and if we pass that OK we stop in this squad until our final exam at Christmas. Yesterday we had a Map reading exam and although I don’t know the results I didn’t do very well but should get through it. Next week we start on practical cable laying. I don’t fancy it much as when laying cable it is done at the double with a drum of cable on your back and also we have to go through rivers, ditches, up trees, etc. Its a 4 mile stretch so it shouldn’t take very long anyway.\nI don’t believe I told you of the chap, who swiped the eye glasses and hopped it, getting caught. It took them a week to get him and in the end was picked up by a copper in Whitehall. He was brought back here. Yesterday he got away again through a window in the lavatory while the guard waited peacefully outside the door. He was caught 2 hours latter 30 miles away. He’ll get it pretty stiff now. The sarg reconds he would have got off pretty lite if he had faced them at the beginning owing to lack of proof but he’ll get a year for this I recond now. He must be off his rocker.\nWell dear my 6 weeks is up now so I’m going to start counting the weeks as they go untill there is only one left and I shall not have to count that one. So I shall be bumping home on the 2nd or 3rd next year.\nWell I think thats all darling so I must say cheerio but never goodbye\nYours\nBern\n"

Don’t say you didn’t loose Ginty when you took him out. You must have had him on a lead! If you was writing that letter while I was asleep in bed you must have been up late (or rather early morning) as I was rather late on Saturday.\nI’ve not noticed that Warren loves getting people into a temper but if thats the case why don’t you suck him in by not loosing it.\nSorry if Usines has troubled you but it gave me a ton of trouble so I can’t see why other people can’t have a share. Also at the time when I did it I had some work to do as well. I chased all over Whitechapel for that blinkin’ account. I don’t know if you have found that file with all their invoices, it was in the strong room when I left 5 months ago. I don’t suppose you will want thoose invoices though as I believe thats all cleared up and above board now. Anyway, some of those invoices do not agree with the statement owing to some corrections to be made to the latter.\nI’m glad the sun was shining on Saturday. Its nothing for the sun to shine here as its shining all day generally, although there isn’t any strength in it. We get some nasy frosts here, this morning the ground was frozen and like concrete to walk on until the sun came out and turned it into slippery mud. I got up after 11 on Sunday although I got up at 8 for breakfast.\nYes, I recieved Bucks’ 5/- OK, I’ll write them tonight after this.\nI didn’t do so well with the written test on monday as I came 6th and only 40 out of 60, still I passed thats the main thing. I map reading and bearings I came 3rd with another chap with 11 out of 15. We started on wireless yesterday, and is it a puzzle? We have had 3 periods on it so far and I can’t even tune it in and get it going yet. They try and rush everything too much, though, here. Wait till we start broadcasting on it.\nWe had a bit of fun today. We were taken out in the field and told we were going to have a demonstration on RA code with two lamp stations. One station was set up about 200 yds away and two of the N.C.O.s (who were to work the other signalling station) went with there gear into a hut. Some minutes passed then the officer baulled out for them to hurry up. The sarg in the hut shouted out \"You wait a ----- minute, whos doing the ------ job, you or me?\" The officer then told him he didn’t want any of his lip and the sarg went on swearing and cursing at him. In the end it turned out to be a comic scetch of how not to set up an O.P. signal station. I’ve not laughed so much since I’ve been in the army!\nI don’t think there is anything else darling.\nGive my love to all at home and goodnight dear.\nYours\nBern\n"

Its no good getting heated up over exams. I never was any good at school anyway.\nYou say Craze was home for a few hours last week. He must be a bit dappy to come home for a few hours, mustn’t he? Still, he always was daft.\nWe’ve been on a cable scheme this afternoon. We went out almost to Dartmoor by lorry and getting there we lost ourselves. We got to a village but couldn’t find it on the map and on enquiring at a house found that it wasn’t on the map as it was too small. I was what they call O.P. Telephonist. This is what I had to carry :- belt with wire cutters and mattock, a telephone set, earth pin, a RA handset with a drum of cable, as well as steel Helmet and gasmask. We laid a mile of cable and when I connected the telephone set up we didn’t get through to exchange at the other end. The mantainance men had to go along the line to find what was wrong. The bluepencil officer Woods had gone round with some wirecutters and cut the wire. I was laying out in that field for 25 minutes before I got thro!\nThe weather wasn’t too bad today although there was no sun and a times it looked like rain. Still, it didn’t rain thankgoodnes and we got back at 6 o’clock.\nWell darling another week nearly over, a week nearer to the leave I’m looking forward to. I shan’t be sorry when this course is over. Every day I seem to get more fed up. 3 months is too long.\nSitting there puzzling your brain all day makes you feel fed up to the hilt. We have earnt those 6d a day by the time we’ve finished. Never mind the time is going pretty quick.\nWe have some spuds tonight which we scrounged from a farmer. We’re having baked spuds for supper.\nWell, I must write home tonight darling so forgive me if the letter isn’t very long as I don’t want to be to bed late.\nGoodnight, love\nYours\nBern\nPS In ‘desert discs’ they have just started playing yours\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nGnr B Shepherd\nSignal Training \nFort Staddon\nPlymstock\nPlymouth\nDevon\n\nDarling,\nI recieved your Thursdays letter safely thanks dear.\nGlad Bucks got my letter OK, altho I can’t understand it as you say that you havent recieved one from me, yet I posted them both together. It doesn’t take long to scribble off a note to Bucks so I always make a habbit of writing back straight away.\nI bet by this time you’ve caught a lovely cold from Tim. Your croud loves catching colds, don’t they?\nIts dinner time now so I’ll have to pack up for a little while.\n2-15\nI’ve had my dinner now consisting of fried potatoes, cabage and I believe mutton, (but I’m not much judge of meat especialy in the army) and what was supposed to be trifle.\nYesterday we went to the Royal and saw a couple of good films, ‘Your in the army now’ and also ‘They gave him a gun’. I expect you have seen them. There was a bit of a mix up in the middle as they began to show a part of ‘Your in the army Now’ in the middle of the other one. I wondered what was wrong with the bluepencil film but they soon shoved it off.\nIt is very dismal here today and looks as though its going to rain. It did begin to rain a bit while we were marching to church this morning but it soon stopped thank goodness. Its about 20 minutes walk to the church and we’d have got just about soaked.\nWe’ve got a moan on now. A new idea has just come out that we have a regimental parade for meals instead of just taking your time over to the dining rooms. Everyone parades on the square thus waisting about 10 minutes while breakfast gets cold.\nThis morning there was a lousie officer on duty and we had only just rolled out of bed and straight on to the square. He told us off right and left for not having our anclettes on but if he had known that three parts of us had only got slippers on he would have had a blue fit. It was too dark to distinguish them from boots.\nI can’t think of any more news to slip into the letter just now although I’ve heaps of time to spare. I’m afraid that now-adays its difficult to think of much to put into letters especialy to people you don’t know so well. The first time you write to them its OK as you can swing them a tale all about the army. After that its a case of \"I’m alright, I hope you are too, cheerio\"\nWell, we are up one on Rene and Eddie now I think. I expect she wishes her leave was just a month ahead. In another month I should be within a few days of seeing you dear that is if I pass. Please remember that darling as I don’t want to disappoint you. Even if I pass in all my tests I may fail with my morse readings or something. I quite believe I will pass but there is just a possibility that I shan’t.\nWell darling give my love to Mum, Rene, and Tim and don’t forget yourself. Cheerio\nYours Bern\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nGnr B Shepherd\nFort Staddon\nPlymstock\nPlymouth\nDevon\n\nDearest,\nI’ve got two of your letters to answer Fridays and Sundays so bobs yer uncle.\nOne of the letters censored was it? Its a mad idea really as we could post them outside if there was anything in them that shouldn’t be.\nGlad you found those Usine invoices, they should all be there.\nI recond BL is in a state. I can see it wants my ruling power to boss that office. The real reason for so much trouble in that office is the fact that there are too many girls in it and only 2 men (Burden and Hume). When you get a lot of girls together without someone looking after them, the net result is havoc.\nWe got our wireless working the day after it konked out. We have now got another one now, a brand new 6 valve press button set which cost £20. Its a beauty. They fixed it up today. It was bought with RA funds. Don’t talk to me about wireless, I know sweet Fanny Adams about it.\nThe time is going pretty quick to me but I never said so as I thought you may think different. I +could imagine you writing back \"Its all very well\n[Rest of letter missing]\n"

It soon slips round to the week ends again, doesn’t it?\nThanks for Fridays letter, it did reach me yesterday as you hoped.\nYou didn’t get your way about Rosie Childs friend then as you say she is starting on monday. I suppose she is to take the place of the one Warren booted. You all seem to be pretty slack there, are the accounts going down or are some of you working? I can’t tell what Miss Childs friend is like if you don’t know her, still its nothing to do with me.\nYes, I’m getting more browned off every day, sitting there puzzling my brains out. Enough to make everyone fed up. The first month is the best as everything is fresh but its turning into boredom now. I’m pretty sure I’ll be able to pass the written tests OK but its the b------ buzzer readings etc I’m not so sure on.\nSorry to hear you’ll have to stop your morning tea but I cannot see that its much of a necessity really.\nDon’t take any notice of that ‘bone and rags’ Pascoe. She’d make a mountain out of a flat cricket pitch. Ten to one he only spoke to here as he went by. If anything ever did happen to her it would be as much (if not more) her fault than the chaps. Darling, men ain’t such gorillas as you imagine. If such were the case why do so many women go around with them? They must be as bad. Most of the chaps are about the same as I am so I can’t see why you should be so against them.\nWe went to Plymouth yesterday, one chap wanted to buy one of our ordinary kaki hats as his other was a bit grubby and they wouldn’t issue him with another. The price was 8/6 so he walked out again. They cost 1/10 ½ at the stores when you can get one.\nWe made tracks to the Regal where ‘Gone with the wind’ was showing and booked 4 seats for the next show which was at 6oclock. We went and had tea at a YMCA and went in the Pictures. Its a marvelious film isn’t it darling? I just about enjoyed it and if you had been there too it would have been a really nice evening. Everyone acted their part to a T and I’m sure its the best film that has ever been made. There were quite a few laughs in it, although it was a serious film. If I had anything to do with a girl like that I’d strangle her. Jolly good luck to him when he chucked her.\nWell, I can’t think of any more news for the moment dear so forgive me if I close now. Give my love to all at home and look after yourself, cheerio\nYours\nBern\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nGnr B Shepherd\nFort Staddon\nPlymstock\nPlymouth\nDevon\n\nDarling,\nNow I’ll start this letter. The electricity hasn’t been on this evenining until a minute ago so I’ve had no chance of writing as its rather awful scribbling in the dark. Its now 8.30 there is a nice miniture gale blowing outside I wouldn’t be surprised (Its not 8.55) if that hasn’t something to do with it. The lights went out again and were out for another 25 minutes. They keep flickering so I’m expecting them to go out again.\nI was going to write yesterday but, being out on that cable scheme, we had to do some cleaning up. We had a time yesterday on the scheme as it poured with all day. We had to cross 4 streams there and back making it eight in all and it was on the moors where it was boggy and in 2 places I sank down about 18 inches in slime and mud. To make things better it was against a clay works (white) and everywhere was slimy white, even the steams. From my thighs downwards I was soaked right through and being raining I was soaked through top as well. Anyway, I realy enjoyed myself. The officer came along with the sarg after we had got the cable out and the telephone working and started talking to me and cleverly cut the wire while doing so but fortunately we spotted it. They were throwing smoke and explosive charges at us all the way which gave it a realistic effect. A pal of mine, Drury (he had his bonoculars swiped) goes in for photography in a big way and he took quite a few photos of us at work for the officer. He wants to show future squads how good we were. Altho’ the weather was so bad he said the thought that most of them would come out (his camera cost £40) Its a lovely thing.\nNow, to answering your letter darling.\nYour always running down your own letters dear altho I myself can’t see why as they are alot clearer to read than mine. My mothers the one for writing though, she scribbles them away leaving out words whenever she feels like it. I’m sorry you was unfortunate going round to Mums on sunday. It seldom that she goes out on a sunday during The winter unless they were down the garden.\nWell dear as I must write to mum tonight if I can and the lights don’t go out, I must close down. \nBoth Mum and Dad send there love and hope that you’re ok and hope to see you soon\nGoodnight dearest\nBern\nPS lights just gone out again\n"

Maybe you’ll be able to think of one for me.\nI don’t know why I’m getting too cheeky, I suppose its something I put in my last letter but please remember darling its the pens fault. Its uncontrollable!\nYou don’t seem to realise that a soldier must have his morning cup of tea as he works so hard. They stop the war in africa every day at 10.30 and hand round tea. Why should you want tea in the mornings, anyway?\nI can imagine you storming off when he (Warren I mean) altered the lunch hours arround. Thats what comes of comming in late every day.\nI think it would be a grand idea for you to ask Warren for a couple of days for when I come home but don’t tell him when I should have it incase he doesn’t agree with the idea. I don’t like the idea of your taking time off; your mother doesn’t and neither does mine, so everyone would be happier if Warren gave you the time off.\nWhy not go round to my mothers of a weekend. Its no joke going round there of an evening especialy if it was anything like it was here last night.\nWe went out in the afternoon and it was about the best afternoon for over a week so we didn’t take out greatcoats. When we came out of the gaumont it was simply pouring down and we had a ¼ hrs walk to the YMCA, 10 minutes to the station and half hours walk from station to Staddon so you can tell we were pretty wet through. There was another gale last night and it blew the rain so hard against your face that it stung like ----- I said a few things about this wonderful fort staddon. Thank goodness we are not here much longer.\nOne of our chaps had a narrow squeek lsat week. Him, mac and I went over to have a shave on thursday evening and it was pitch black. I washed a couple of handkerchiefs so was a couple of minutes later comming out than them and when I came back to the barrack room Ginger was stretched out on the bed with the medical orderly there.\nI found out afterwards that in the dark he fell down about 20 stone stairs which lead to those underground rooms that I told you of. There are quite a few of theese stair cases arround with no protection to stop anyone from falling down in the dark.\nHes jolly lucky as, although he hurt his back, its OK again now. Its a wonder he didn’t break it. I’m always very careful myself in the dark as the one he fell down is only a couple of yards from our door. We go over in convoy with a torch in the front.\nWe are having a dance up here tomorrow night for the signal Wing. The boys here with the instruments have made quite a decent band. I don’t think it will be any good though as it is being held in the NAAFI and there are 50 chaps, 50 girls, and 15 officers with 15 ATS officers and the NAAFI isn’t big enough to seat 100, let alone dancing. It’ll be a free fight! If its anything like I think it will be I’m going in for a drink and out again.\nWell dear I don’t think its worth while starting another page so bye bye darling\nBern\n"

Still, as santa clause says this year, I’ll find something to put in it.\nThe weather has been a lot better theese last 2 days and have no more occurances of the lights going out.\nMum says she can’t understand why she never heard you when you visited the other day as she was in all night!\nWe had that dance last night which I was telling you about on Sunday. We had two period off yesterday to get it ready. We set up a stage for the band and hung big signaling flags (used on the ships) from the roof to the floor all the way round the walls. Smaller flags (semephore) also decorated the room, signaling lamps made fine spot lights and a signallers microphone was just the thing for announcing the dancers. The dance itself went tons better than anyone expected and I, and everyone else realy enjoyed themselves. The band was superb. I was speaking to a PT sarg who was there, he said that its the best band he has heard in the plymouth area and he goes to quite a few. If I enjoy myself like I did last night at Christmas, I shan’t do to bad.\nWe are going out on a scheme on sunday all days. Its a bit of cheek making us work on a sunday but if its fine I should enjoy myself as there is no hard work attached to it. Its a wireless scheme.\nWe are in a bit of a muddle in the barrack room tonight. Until tonight there were only 12 of us in this room and we were just comfortable spaced but more room is required in the fort so they shoved some men from the othe squad into here making it 20. We’ve got about 9\" space between each bed now so there is no chance of falling out of bed.\nIts a good job we are not here much longer. I hope you can read this pencil darling as it doesn’t seem to show up very much.\nI don’t think there is anything else to write about now dear so I’ll ring up now and press Button ‘B’\nGive my love to all at home. Goodnight dearest\nYours Bern\n"

Sorry you didn’t have one to answer on Monday but it wont be much longer. Glad you had a fine time at the week end, it certainly makes a break from the Bluepencil office.\nCatch me cleaning my buttons of a week end! Thats no trick of mine. So you can imagine me in the army, I wouldn’t say \"living a soldiers life\" you mean \"living a artifical Soldiers life\". There is nothing in making one of our beds and darning is dead simple. Mind you its my own patent as I’ve never been shown how it should be done but my way works OK and thats the main point. Have I been on Woolich ferry. Sure I have, not lately though.\nI told you that Pascows tale was all lies. Its those sort of girls that give us a bad name. A Soldiers got more respect than to tough a thing like that, they’re too particular. And your so daft to believe her! Get rid of that idea of yours about men. We went out on the wirless scheme today. Everyone had a wireless set and were placed about here by van with control stations inside the fort. We then commmunicated between each other all the afternoon and as the weather was very good, we all enjoyed ourselves.\nI’ve just been to a film in the rec room \"Rome Express\" also another about tea with a Micky Mouse as usual.\nWell darling I’ve alot to do tonight so I’ll close now.

I’m having Kaoline pollaces on it.\nI missed the cable scheme that they had to day owing to this bluepencil thing. The boys came back absolutely dripping as it was a real river they had to cross, it came up to their chests. None of them seem to have any inclination to go through it again. Its a wonder they don’t all catch neuphonia (can’t spell it)\nI have used my pad up so have torn a page out of an old book I have. I don’t use the book anyway.\nWell darling I must close now as I’ve to answer two more that I received today. When I went to the P.O. to collect your parcel the poor old postman was surrounded with parcels and reg letters all over the place. \nHes got a busy job on just now.\nWell darling bue bue for a while, the time is drawing near now, isn’t it?

With this bluepencil carbuncil I’m confined to barracks. I’m what they call IOC which means I mustn’t do army duties at all and (being so bad, I don’t think) am also C.B. My old carbuncil is alot better now as they have got alot of the matter out. I’m still having the Kaolene on it.\nWe have had our exams and I don’t think I did too badly on them. All that lies between me and Ilford now is my readings and a week. I shall pass theese readings if I have to stay up all night practicing.\nWe are having a pretty good feed up to all accounts tomorrow but I’ll be able to tell you what it is like next week.\nI recieved your mothers christmas card today. Will you thank her for me, tell her I’m sorry if I didn’t send her one but you know what my heads like.\nYes, its not a had idea of my mothers, and I’m quite agreeable with it if you are. Actually, its not for me to decide as your working (or rather staying) at B.B.Bucks.\nWell dear only another week and we should be together again. It hardly seems possible to me but it is.\nI don’t feel much like writing on Xmas eve, so I’ll ring off now darling\nGoodnight dear\nYours\nBern \n"

Evidently one of them was held up with the Xmas rush.\nI hope you enjoyed yourself yesterday OK. It wasn’t too bad here altho it wasn’t anything like we generally have as we bring the house down at Hampton Rd at Christmas time. I couldn’t go out Christmas eve as I’m confined to barracks with my neck and about 11 the sarg and Bom came in well oiled and tipped everybodys’ bed up. Just about 12 the boys came in and they too had had quite a bit so we raided them and it finished up with stirrup pumps, so you can tell that the sargs barrack room was in a bit of a mess. I went out Yesterday, though, and had quite a good time.\nI’m sorry you didn’t get a letter from me for 5 days but you’ll have to blame the G.P.O. as I posted them OK. You recieved them, thats the main thing.\nYes, I recieved Bucks’ money alright. I have written a letter to them but maybe its been held up.\nI’ll write to Warren about my Holiday money. You made my laugh saying \"Make it a polite one\". Do you expect me to tell them what I think of Bucks or something?\nWell darling time is getting very short now and we shall soon be moving to the depot. Whether we will have leave on Friday or not I can’t say as it depends whether they keep us at depot for a few days. The journey down will be alot better than last time as theres nearly everybody comming to Paddington. I don’t envy Gingers journey to the Aukneys. The train didn’t seem to go fast enough last time.\nTo commence, I’ve been helping some chap to rub down his brass flags that he has bought. I don’t know whether to buy some brass ones or not, as I think the cloth flags look just as good. The worst of those though is that they soon get dirty and shabby. All our flags are in the office ready for the presentation on the square on Wednesday. We’ll all be busily showing them on wednesday night, I suppose. I don’t think there is much else to wear my pencil down except that (all being well) I shall be leaving here on Thursday so if you get this letter in time don’t send any letters that wont reach me by Wednesday.\nGoodnight darling remember I’ll soon be seeing you\nYours for ever\nBern\nxxxxxxx\n"

I’m sorry dear but I’m afraid it can’t be helped now. I could have burst into tears when they told me today and I feel pretty rotten now with all the chaps who have passed all around me as excited as possible packing up their gear ready to leave on Thursday. There were 3 who did not pass and it was the buzzer that let me down and made my average below 97.5. They gave me 4 readings to try and pull me out of it but it couldn’t be done. I have done it on the buzzer and I was hiping that I’d have been able to have done it on monday but it was impossible. I believe half of the trouble was because it was a test. Something I’ve been looking forward to for the last six weeks. Sorry darling I suppose you opened this letter fully expecting to see when I was coming home. I shall try and get my leave as I’ll see our O.C. in the morning and see if he will. I may only get a weekend but it will be better than nothing. One thing, it means that I shall be training another month and one more month nearer to the end of this war. To me it doesn’t seem true that one day I shall be back in civy street and seeing you darling every day. I shall make sure and make up for the time we’ve been apart then.\nDo you know darling I don’t feel much like talking of the usual things that we talk about, mainly because, I suppose, we generaly write about things of the present and the present isn’t very good just now.\nIts been very cold today and snow has been falling (an unheard of thing here) and we have been working outside today as we’ve been removing all the signal office to a larger hut and making a decent path to it as it was surrounded with mud. It hasn’t been too warm as we havent had quite enough to make us swet.\nI suppose we’ll have a pretty easy time this next month as I passed the written exam with flying colours so it is only the readings that we shall have to contentrate on. I shouldn’t think we will have to do the exams again now that we have passed them.\nWell darling I suppose I shall have to break the bad news to mum and dad at home now so I’ll have to stop, although I;m sure I could fill another two pages if I kept on.\nNever mind darling I’ll do the best I can to get a bit of ‘leave’ but don’t bank on it too much.

I don’t know how long we shall get either but I shan’t mind so much as long as I get some leave. The chaps that left here today are not going home until monday so it wont make alot of odds. We have been labourers this morning carting chippings up to the lecture rooms and making a path with them where it was just mud.\nIts a lovely day here today and its hardly possible to believe that it is December even if it is the last day.\nThere is very little news here darling as we are doing next to nothing now, just passing the time away the best we can. We are going to the pictures tonight if all is well, I don’t know whats on but there should be something pretty good as there is quite a selection of cinimas.\nI am posting this letter with the 3 oclock post which i don’t think I have done before so you may recieve it at a different time to what you usualy do. There are two posts per day here, one at 8am and the other 3pm. I generaly write my letters over night and post them first thing the following morning.\nDarling, cheerio, I’ll be seeing you very soon so don’t dispair\nYours till the world stops turning,\nBern\n"

I don’t know what time, how long or anything about it as we havent seen the officer ourselves yet but I expect it will be Monday morning. There is the 08:30 train which I caught last time which I shall catch if possible but it being Sunday I don’t know whether it will be possible to get out pass in time. It would take over an hour to get to the station so we should have to get out pass about 7. The next train is round about noon which should get me in about 5 or 6 as it is a fast train.\nOur Bombardier has been getting this leave for us and as yet Cptn. Woods hasn’t said a word to us about it. The Bombardier, Brack, told us this morning.\nWe are doing nothing but kill time here and are doing one or two odd jobs about the fort to pass the time away.\nWe went to the pictures last night and saw \"Dr. Broadway\" and \"Who done it\" at the Odeon. We had a free tea and supper at the Central Hall church which was quite a surprise. We went in there about 5 as we left too early for tea in the barracks, we piled our plates up with sandwiches and cake as we were feeling hungry and asked how much. We were told it was New Years eve everything was free and offered round apples and cigarettes. We soon slipped across for supper when we returned from the Odeon.\nWell dear, I can tell you every scrap of news I want to in 3 days time so I’ll get write a note off to mum and tell her. I’ll write and give you all the dope when I get it.\nSo cheerio loved one,\nYours,\nBern\n\nP.S. will you make a date with that Photographer (no, not that sort of Date)\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nShepherd\nSignal 7g Wg\nFort Staddon\nPlymstock\nPlymouth\n\nDarling,\nThank you very much for your letters dear and also the paper and envelopes. I hope to be able to write a long letter today to make up for not writing yesterday when we went out. I am trying to imagine it is 13 days ago, when we were both together, and make out that I am speaking to you instead of scribbling on this pad. I believe I enjoyed that 10 days even better than my first leave.\nNext time I come home the weather will be alot better than before and we shall be able to venture a bit further outside the door.\nTich and I are having quite a jammy time here now as we don’t have to go through the exam again as we’ve already passed. In the reading tests on Friday I passed in the buzzer. It makes me wild when I think that I didn’t do it at the exam. I do a bit of buzzer reading every night so I should be alright when the exam comes off. Anyway I’ve bought a pair of flags now so I shall have to pass. They are cloth ones which in my opinion look a jolly sight better than the brass which quite a few have bought.\nIt hasn’t been a very good weekend in this dump, although it didn’t rain yesterday afternoon it was miserable and sloshy as it rained in the morning. Today it has been raining ever since I got up and looks like stopping about next Christmas fortnight. I got caught this morning by stopping in bed, as the orderly sergeant came round and put us on fatigues, cleaning out the office. There were 3 of us so it didn’t take long.\nWe are on this fire picket today which confines us to these blinkin’ walls but had arrangement for another chap in C squad to take my place so that I could go out. The rain has changed my mind though as we have to walk back on Sundays. Rain never was a per of mine, unless in a divers suit.\nYesterday afternoon after we had bought our flags and had tea, we saw \"The Gay Sisters\" and \"Dr Gillespie\" (I forget the whole title) at the Royal. Wasn’t bad.\nThere is a proper moan down here now as they only allow us 1 cake per day in the NAAFI. They must think we may over eat or something.\nWell darling, I think that is about all the odd bits I can tell you, altho I don’t feel a bit like packing up yet, I’m just in the mood for writing (to you dear any rate).\nThis time a fortnight ago I was at North Rd. Station having a cup of tea and you were at home I expect not knowing that I was on the way home to you. I shall not forget meeting you on Monday morning and dragging you back through the barrier.\nThe whole time went like a flash but we had quite a long time together and we were not parted for long during those 10 days. So let us both keep smiling it wont be long before I’m back again.\nYou will go round and see mum one weekend wont you darling?\nBye bye,\nYours,\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

I can imagine him storming away saying under his breath \"These girls, can’t be trusted to carry an umbrella safely.\" (Only not so mildly as that)\nOf all the cheek! You bust that zip fastener and then calmly write down in black and white that I did it. \nStill its the worst of these cheap zips isn’t it?\nYou should have given Miss Edny my Love not just regards, it sounds so much better (are you getting any more suspicious.) Anyway, whats this gag about spelling suspicion?\nI wrote to Bucks about my holiday money yesterday. I don’t know whether I put it so-so and polite but I did the best I could with what little grey matter I have been supplied with. If you have anything to do with it, I should like the money sent home.\nI got the 5/- from Bucks this morning too and will write them after I’ve finished this (If I have time).\nI got a rise of 3/6 this week which will come in handy. I have now been in the army for 6 months. I’ve just written a line off to Bucks and now I’ll make my way down and get ready for bed so Goodnight darling.\nYours,\nBern\n--- .... / - --- / -... . / .. -. / .. .-.. ..-. --- .-. -..

I like the way you said \"The rain you had on Sunday.\" I can’t remember hardly a day going by here without it raining.\nI havent recieved the money from Bucks yet unless he had the sense to send it home.\nHow many cakes do I need a day? Well, we generally have two in the morning with a cup of tea and also 2 at night. Remember we don’t have any supper. Anyway, they have gone back to 2 in the morning and 2 at night again now so its OK now.\nWe have just come back from a visual scheme which we have been on all the afternoon. We got back here about 6:30. I feel rather tired just now and have a wonderful headache as we were reading through telescopes. The wonder of it was it didn’t rain until we were coming home in the van.\nWe were on a cable scheme on Tuesday and it poured the whole time. We were out the whole afternoon so you can tell how we got soaked. Most of the chaps had to go through 2 rivers (remember when the other squad went through it whole I had that illness and I missed it). One party when they got to the end, they were near a house, a lady came out and told them to come inside out of the wet. They had just come through a 4 foot river!\nGoodnight darling, sorry its not very long but I don’t feel up to it.\nYours everlasting,\nBern\nxxxxxxxxx\n"

B Shepherd\nSignal Wing\nFort Staddon\n\nDarling Kath,\nIts against my principle to write letters on a Saturday afternoon but we are on this picket and can’t go out.\nI have recieved my holiday money from Bucks today signed by miss Barton, who had put a note on the bottom asking how I am getting on with my new job. I can’t appreciate the lovely country as she puts it, as the countryside never does look much in the winter.\nWe had out weekly reading tests on Friday and I feel very pleased with myself with my results. I got 100% semaphore and morse flag and 99.5% for buzzer and lamp. That means I got 2 letters wrong in about 600 letters. We have out readings on Monday which I hope is as nice a day as Friday was. It was just like summer here on Friday and made me realise how nice it would be here during the summer months. That was how I was able to get such good readings as I can;t stand the least bit of wind in my eyes.\nI don’t feel in the least bit like writing tonight realy darling. I don’t know why but my brain seems to lazy to think.\nThere are flags and a sig. Lamp going full steam ahead here tonight for those who are not too sure of their readings and it looks like coronation day in Hyde Park. It is Sunday now darling (hasn’t it gone quick) and almost dinner time. I was going to finish this letter early this morning but we shoved on fatigues cleaning out the barrack rooms, then I went for a haircut which took another hour and to finish it we had to clean the rifles of the bombardiers who had just been on a shoot. (remember, you boil them)\nI expect we shall all be out celebrating on Wednesday night all wearing our flags. I wonder where I shall be off to next week. It may be Wanstead Park guarding the lake. Canvey Island would be very handy though. Thats where one of them went last month.\nYou asked me in your last letter what did I get the rise for? It was the war proficiency pay. You always get that after being in the services for 6 months as long as you’ve committed no crimes etc.\nWell darling, I don’t think there is anything else for the present. I hope you don’t have any more of these bluepence raids and also I shouldn’t get to the office at 8:45 too often, Warren might have a breakdown or something.\nBye bye dearest, it wont be such a very long time before we are doing the midnight march up Sunnyside Road again.\nYours always,\nBern\nXxxxxxxxx\n"

I thought I would tell you that you are now reading a letter of a Gunner Signaller. I passed OK in my readings today, although the weather was terrible. There was terrific wind and rain almost the whole day. There are only two who didn’t pass, both with their readings but we had a good idea that they would not pass as they were both pretty bad on readings.\nI’ve sewn my flags on tonight (after a style) although we wont wear them until it is officially announced on daily orders which will most probably be tomorrow.\nI recieved your letter today darling, thank you very much.\nDon’t worry dear, if I get half a chance I shall be seeing you not phoning. There is quite a bit of chance of coming to London as its quite a big terminus.\nI’m afraid this letter is short and sweet but I must write and tell 40 Hampton that I’m now.

I have broken out with alot of spots and yesterday went to see the MO about it. He says its not chicken pox and wont let me leave here until its cured. \nThey are putting some stuff on them. Theres been quite a row because he wont let me go but I suppose hes playing for safety. It does not realy worry me, I don’t know whether I shall be here another month or get posted when I am OK again.\nAll the rest are going to Samford tomorrow to be posted. They are pretty excited as they are going on leave.\nThanks for your letter darling so sorry I didn’t thank you before. I’m getting absent minded in my old age.\nWe had our celebrations on Tuesday instead of tonight as the Bombardier is on Guard tonight we had a jolly fine time.\nI’m sorry if I’m never (whats the word) - Explicit dear. I know you’re pretty good at guessing so I don’t worry. Seriously though dear I didn’t realise I left out important things like that, and in future I’ll make sure and put them in. (I hope)\nAs a matter of fact, I havent any definite day for not writing to you dear but the usual procedure on a Saturday to leave directly after dinner and arrive back between 11-12 so as a rule Saturday is ruled out for writing.\nYes darling I know how you feel about my posting, I feel the same. If its far apart we can still keep writing the same and you’ll always be with me. It wouldn’t be much different to this place as I can’t get home here.\nI sewed the pair of flags on that I bought but today have been presented with 2 pairs of army issue flags that are as good if not better than the ones I’ve bought. The last squad was only issued with one pair of tripish things consisting of a piece of cloth with flags stenciled on them. Thats the reason for me buying those others.\nI’ve just been round to the naffi where they are issuing free suppers out which I suppose you could read about in the papers last weekend. Every army Naffi now gives out free suppers and good they are too. We get a hot meal and cocoa which goes down very well.\nThe sarg. has just been in the barrack room and says that I shall be posted as soon as the MO things fit to let me go. It should not be very long.\nWell dear, I can’t think of anything else to write about just now. I hope I have not left you to guess too much tonight and you had better keep writing here until I tell you I’ve moved.\nGood night darling, give my love to all at 59 and thank you for writing so often.\nYours,\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

I have nothing to do so I thought I’d drop a line. I havent had much to do all day realy, although the day seems to have gone by pretty quickly.\nThe other chaps all left today and I believe they are going on leave tomorrow. Another squad has now taken their place in here and its pretty crammed now as there are 20 of is in this room. Still, it wont be for very long for me anyway. Those spots whatever they are are almost smaller than what they were and seem to be going OK. I should be moving in a week or so at the outside.\nI do everything lefthanded now by the way. You see, the flags are on the left arm. See blokes looking at my arm as though they’ve never seen flags before, as only the signal instructors are about here and I suppose it looks strange to see a Gnr. Signaller strolling around.\nI’ve just been to the naffi and one of the naffi chaps claimed to have been sig. in the last war. By the way he was talking all the signs tipped and mixed up to what they were in 1914. The Naffi manager was saying that they hardly sell a thing in there now that they issue free suppers. I don’t wonder at it.\nThere is no more \"Staddon news\" that I can think of darling, so I’m afraid I shall have to close. The time is slipping by until the time when we are together again and also till the time when there is no more war. How grand it will be when I come back for good. Its not very far away either I feel sure.\nGoodnight dearest,\nYours,\nBern\nP.S. I nearly put my own address on the envelope. I should have said something if I got my own letter back.

Sig Shepherd\nSignal Wing\nFort Staddon\nPlymstock\nPlymouth\nDevon\n\nDearest,\nJust one or two lines as I shall not be writing tomorrow owing to the usual Plymouth visit. \nThank you so much for your letter of Wednesday darling I recieved it this morning. The letter I wrote last night didn’t go until 3 o’clock post so you will get these two letters almost together I expect. Yes, I felt quite pleased when I put my flags, I feel as if I’ve earnt them anyway. Tuesday night we had a fine time. There were 20 of us in all, the 17 who passed, the Bombardier Sargent and Signal Storeman. First we went to a small church canteen in Plymouth and the people running it nearly had a fit when we all strolled in. We nearly bought the whole place up. They were cutting up tons of sandwiches and selling those big cakes whole. We then went on to a nice little pub and enjoyed ourselves. Most of the chaps were youngsters and couldn’t take it and we had a proper job getting them home. That half hours walk up the hill sobered most of them off luckily so that they weren’t too bad for reporting to the guard room. Not that it mattered much as there was a decent guard commander on and we are nearly all pretty friendly with him.\nI believe I can sort of half answer your question of where am I going to. I’ve heard unofficially that I’m going north west with another chap. How far N.W. I’m going I don’t know but lets hope its not too far.\nWhat, has Burnie been having his photo done again. That reminds me I’ll have to write him some time.\nI’ve been mucking about in the signal stores today, mending one or two instruments that have knocked out and generally mucking about. I suppose I’ll hide myself in there tomorrow morning too as theres a nice fire to sit round and have a chat. \nWell I must close now darling and get to bed so Goodnight dear, give my love to your mother, Rene and Tim, and a big kiss to yourself.\nYour loving Bern.\n"

My fault, I didn’t fasten the flap on the case you gave me.\nThe weather has been absolutely terrible this weekend. I believe the wind is trying to wipe Fort Staddon off the face of the earth so if the next letter from me comes from Mars you’ll know whats happened. Our wash house has suffered pretty badly with it as both the room and one side are hanging half off.\nIt hailed so much yesterday dinner time that it layed on the ground like snow. It has been raining on and off since yesterday morning. Last night coming home we could hardly keep on our feet with the wind. We saw \"Lost Ranger\" and another film called \"Three different eyes\". Both \"In which we Serve\" and \"Big Street\" were on in Plymouth yesterday.\nWe had egg and bacon for breakfast this morning which went down very well as you can bet. Everyone got up in time for breakfast today. Theres only one thing I don’t like about Sunday and that is the tea. All we get as a rule is bread & jam. Still we can’t grumble at the food too much on the average.\nTheres a new squad in here now and they are nearly all coppers, at least they were, so they are quite a big lot of chaps. They’re a decent lot too from what I’ve seen of them so far.\nI’ve sat here for about 10 minutes (which is unusual for me) trying to think of something else but it looks as though I’m beat. I hate sending you such a short letter darling. I like to make the postman work as hard as possible for his quid. I’d write 5 pages if I could think of enough. Dashed if I know what Harry Smith (in the last squad) used to put in his 5 page letters every day. One weekend he wrote 14 pages large size. I think that wants some beating. Still he was married and I suppose that makes some difference. What with all the house and money matters etc. He was a proper moaner though, I should imagine his wife must have to put up with alot. He’ll be a proper old custard when he gets older. (I said custard)\nHow is everyone at the office now including Miss Joyner. I’ll write old Burnie this afternoon after I’ve written to Mum and to Dad who is now back in Dowlias.\nWell dear I must bring the curtain down now for another day and I’ll write again either tomorrow or Tuesday according to the way things to go.\nGive my love to 59 and a big kiss all for you.\nYours darling for ever\nBern\n\n"

I thought it was funny that I never recieved any since Thursday. They must have got held up.\nI’ll have thought you’d have twigged that one about being lefthanded. Doing things with my left hand shows the flags off better.\nIt looks as though you had the same sort of weather as we had, only we are 500 feet up on top of a hill right on the edge of the sea.\nToday we’ve had a thunder storm, hail, rain, wind and sunshine (not all at once). Everywhere is flooded round here.\nYesterday the oldest squad was going on a visual scheme and the officer asked if I’d like to come so I went. It was where we went before, right on top of a hill with only a dirt track up it. Being so wet and muddy, the lorry was skidding and slipping like me when I started to learn roller skating. When we went to come away the bluepencil van was fixed fast in the mud and it took half an hour to shift it.\nI’m \"working\" in the stores now doing very little, basically examining instruments that have been out and keeping the fire well going just about covers my days work. I also help to keep the form (seat) warm too.\nI’m ok again now, free from all the spots thank goodness. I don’t know when I leave here, probably next Monday.\nI didn’t write to Burnie as I said on Sunday as I felt a bit peckerish by the time I had written 3 letters.\nI can’t think of anything else to write about and its time for supper so I pack up now and find out what they have to eat.\nGoodnight darling, give my live to mum, Rene, and Tim.\nYours always,\nBern\nxoxoxoxoxoxoxo\n"

I’m afraid I’m not at the Canvey Island as I said I was going but it doesn’t matter much as I shall be able to get home quite a bit as its only 1 ½ or 2 hour journey. I travelled to Canvey yesterday which was HQ and was sent down here this morning. Sorry I didn’t write yesterday but didn’t arrive until late and they had to have a kit inspection and something to eat and being tired after the journey went to bed early. I meant to have at least come round and see you as I was only at Fenchurch St but there was no time as we caught the train by the skin of our teeth. I wanted to catch the late train and miss this one (3:25) but the other chap wouldn’t so we have to stick together as our tickets were made out together. If they’d have been separate I should have had the night at home. I felt wild when I had to sit in the train while it stopped in Barking station and watch the old trolly busses going home. I came down with another fellow (the chap who told me I was going to Canvey) and also met Harry Smith at Fenchurch (He had just come off leave) with his wife, so there were three of us came down together. Harry has been posted to Southend, the other chap to Gravesend and me in this place. It is stick right in the centre of acres and acres of fields miles from anywhere with only one or two houses dotted here and there.\nFrom the station (or rather a Halt not a station) its about ½ an hours ride to Gravesend. I tried to ring you up from Gravesend this morning but couldn’t get through. My train came in so I didn’t have another chance. You should see the station where I got off this morning \"Stoke Halt\". A couple of boards with a sentry box on top! Only one man on it who goes home when the train has gone. Only one line track too.\nThere was a vanette waiting at the station for me when I arrived and it was quite a long trip from the station. Sheerness or Gravesend are the nearest towns to us. Busses run to the station I believe so it wont be too bad. At Gravesend I asked a couple of coppers where the station was and they asked where I was going. When I told them Stoke Halt they both laughed and gave me a rough idea of what its like.\nAnyway, I don’t mind as long as I can get home. I shall be seeing you in a week or two so it wont be so bad. I’m afraid it wont be at the weekend though as they work it on a system that married men whose wives are at work have the weekends.\nAccording to all accounts its pretty jammy here and the BSM was speaking to me this morning and said that there is hardly any signalling to be done and no one works hard here and everyone else says the same.\nWell darling, I must write home now so cheerio, I’ll be seeing you pretty soon.\nYours,\nBern\nxxxxxxxx\n"

I am on searchlights at a place about 2 miles from here. I was on duty last night and it generally works round that we are on every third night, although it is sometimes every other night. You will see an addition to the address on the top, well thats the place where the lights are, Yantlet.\nIts a terrible place to get to as its over fields and paths that are covered in places with water. We have to wear wellingtons or we get wet feet. I’m working in a directing station mounted high in the air on iron trellice work with steps up and from inside it looks like the bridge of a ship. In here are the gadgets which control the lights. It is glass three parts round the D/S (Directing Station) so that ships can be seen coming and going. My job mostly is to attend the telephones and messages that come in, help the Directing commander to test the working of the lamps, and to test the phones etc.\nI am going to try and get home one day next week, about Wednesday or something like that. I shall be getting home about eleven in the morning, perhaps before, and shall go back about eight next morning. Depends upon how long it takes. You see, we have to walk from here to the station which is about 3 miles so it takes quite a time. We get from 6 one morning to 12 the next, although it is of no use leaving at 6 as there is no train till later.\nI should imagine the best way home would be to Tilbury and get another train from there to Barking. It shouldn’t take too long. The hours are pretty good, we start at 9, have ½ hrs break in the morning, 12:30 till 2 for lunch, and KO at 4. If on duty we have the afternoon before and the morning after off.\nTheres a decent lot of chaps here, most of them have been here a year or so.\nCheers darling, I’ll write again soon\nYours Bern.\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nGnr. B Shepherd\nYantlet Detach.\nGrain Fort\nIsle of Grain\nKent\n\nDearest,\nThank you very much for that lovely long letter that I recieved this morning. I am on duty again tonight so am unable to go out atleast not to Gravesend or anywhere as I shouldn’t get back in time. Sorry, you were disapointed that I didn’t stop at Canvey but still I’m not far away and thats the main thing.\nI recieved that letter that you sent to Staddon yesterday. Staddon was crossed out and the Stanford address was scribbled on then that was scratched out and Canvey put on. Finaly this address was squeezed at the bottom. Good job it was a large envelope.\nAnyone would think you was scared of me the way you talk about that Christmas eve spree up and I don’t care a hang if you have 50 pints in one night (whiskey). You was alright when I came home and thats the main thing-a-me-bob.\nI don’t care what Bucks or anyone else says. Who are the \"few ‘nice’ people\" that you spoke about. I bet they were only pulling your leg and you fell for it. You aught to be ashamed of it. Don’t tell them you’ve told me (Unless you have done so already) and see what happens when I come up there. It tickled me when I thought of you getting let up there when they promised to tell me.\nYou must have some right people in Bucks now adays that they swipe handbags from a girl of her age. Shes bound not to have much.\nYes I shall get 24 hrs OK and I’m going to try for one for next week.\nIts a good idea of yours of Greta Garbo. I’ll write her down. I’d better get a perm first and have my bottledress pressed. \nWell I’m afraid I can’t write such a long letter as you did dear as its tea time and after tea we have to get ready for the walk to Yantlet so so bye bye darling, give my love to the rest of the family. I’ll write on Monday and let you know when I shall be home.\nBern\n"

Shifting about, you get different ways and times every where you go.\nWe don’t get any raids down here although the warning went once the other day but theres no sign of bomb damage on anything and I don’t believe there has been any bombs dropped for miles around. \nGlad you got a half a crown increase and hope you get your other one you are trying for. I think I’ll put in for an increase and see if I get it.\nOld Lee is lucky getting his bike back after all this time. I wouldn’t have thought it possible that they’d have traced it after a year.\nI don’t know when I’m coming but I’ll find out in the morning and scribble it on the bottom of this letter. I meant to have seen the BSM this afternoon but he went out so I’ll see him in the morning.\nI’m glad you put \"one day perhaps\" after the paragraph about going to the dentice. It was hard enough getting you to go while I was at home so I know you wont go now.\nWell I’m going on fine down here and will tell you all the news (if any) when I get to a little place called Ilford.\nGive my love to Mum, Rene and Tim, so Cheerio I’ll be seeing you\nYour ever loving Bern\nThursday.\n"

I didn’t have to walk from Stoke as I managed to get a petrol lorry ½ the way and a D.R. the rest, so it didn’t take long. I got a Tilbury train straight from Barking so there was no changing in Upminster and had quite a wait at Gravesend for the \"flying flea bite\". \nI passed the time in a snack bar.\nI’m sorry dear, I know I must have disappointed you yesterday being like a bear with this tail cut off, I tried to be natural but you know how it is when you feel queer. When I was comming up yesterday morning, my head was going round and round. I’m alot better now and I saw the Medieval orderly who has given me some tablets to take and I have to report sick in the morning. So next time I’m home I shall be OK I hope, and I shan’t be a blockheaded sourpuss. I know I was so don’t say I wasn’t.\nHasn’t it been a lovely day today dear? It was a real spring afternoon here and wasn’t a bit cold. I expect it was the same at Ilford.\nI should have been on duty tonight but not feeling up to scratch I changed with another chap. Not that it makes much difference realy as there is little or nothing to do down there. I’ll get to bed early tonight and save my money. Most of them have gone to the boozer tonight being payday and the remainder of us will get rudely woken about 11 or 12 tonight.\nWell darling, I can’t think of any more to write for now so I’ll have to put my pencil away.\nGood night darling, give my love to all at home and a big kiss for you darling. \nYours forever,\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

I am in the fort hospital ward with yellow jaunders (I believe thats right). Sorry I didn’t write before but I didn’t feel very much like it. I am feeling a little better now. Its strange that Ken should have it too, as I couldn’t have got it from him as I had it coming on before I had my 24 hrs. I don’t think its catching but if it is I hope you havent caught it.\nI have borrowed this paper from the medical orderly as the naafi is run out.

I got it yesterday before I left to come here. I came down here yesterday afternoon by the ambulance with the MO. It took close on an hour to get here and after seeing me into the right hands the MO went back. This is a civy hospital and I’m in a small ward with only 3 others, all cives. It seems a very nice hospital indeed and so are the chaps here one of whom has jaunders too but he is almost better now. He has been here a week.\nThey have put me on a proper diet here so maybe I’ll be better in a few days. I had veg. soup for tea last night and dry toast and jam for breakfast this morning. I feel as fit as a fiddle and it makes me wild when I have to stay in bed on lovely days such as today. Its glorious here and from the window we can see the boats floating up and down the river which is close by the hospital.\nWe had a 10 minute warning this morning about half past eight, I don’t know if you had it in London. I expect it was a mistake or some thing.\nI’m afraid I have nothing more to write about dear as lying in bed doesn’t bring about many adventurous events to write home about. If I could think of enough I should write a long letter with the amount of time I have on my hands but unfortunately I’m unable to write much on the subject of nothing.\nWill you give my love to Mum, Irene, and Tim and thank you again for the parcel dear.\nYours,\nBern\n"

Actually its quite nice here and the food is good and cooked well too although I don’t get full benefit of it as I’m on a small diet. It generally consists of dry toast and Bovril for breakfast, fish for dinner, dry bread or toast and jam at tea time, and soup and some sweet for supper.\nWhats Pascoes idea of spinning the yarn that she went to Yorkshire for the day? Did she go by spitfire or flying fortress?\nBob Hope has just come on. I think hes a load of tripe, to me rates lower than Tommy Handly and I don’t think much of him. Some of the chaps used to go mad over that program at Plymouth. Hes alright on the films but here I can’t see what there is to laugh at. You see we have a loudspeaker in the ward so it passes the time away well listening to it.\nWell darling, I can’t think of any more dope for today. I hope you are out enjoying yourself as it looks nice out. I expect its a bit chilly out though as its only Febuary.

I shall be writing to them today after I’ve finished this and also one home. I had a letter from dad today who said that if I had still been at Plymouth I should have seen him next week as he will be down that way. He would go down there too late wouldn’t he?\nYes, I gave Thursdays letter to one of the medical orderlies to post, who was going on leave as I had missed the post in the fort. He must have forgotten it. He was a strange chap, according to what he said he was almost the champion of everything in Wales and from all the great deeds he had done deserved the VC six times over. I was told to get ready for coming to hospital about 10 minutes after he had gone.\nI am loosing my nice yellow complection and am getting more like an Englishman again instead of an \"honourable chinaman\" and in myself feel as if I’m wasting my time here. Although I’m still on a strict diet I’m having a lot more to eat and have a hot dinner for supper now as everyone else.\nI hope Burnie passes his other medical OK, 6 months deferment is quite a bit and the war will be well on the way to packing up by that time I hope.\nDid he ever say whether I wrote to him or no as I forget whether I did while I was at Plymouth? I told you I was going to and I have a strong suspicion that I did but I shouldn’t like to bet on it.\nMaybe I’m dence or something but dashed if I can think of any reason for you to remark about \"having no connection with the Black Market\". I suppose its some crack I’ve put in my letter but unfortunately I’ve been asleep since I wrote it.\nThank you very much dear but I think I’d prefer your own letters to that of Dennis. I never did enjoy his conversation and I believe he liked mine just as much.\nI envy you spending an energetic hour in the garden, I should say its just the weather for gardening just now. Its certainly not right to stay in bed. I’m getting sick of laying here. Its strange though, as I sleep very well at night which seems queer after lazing around like this all day. I havent got any books to read so if that book you spoke of it a paper cover type would you send it down darling, please?\nIf its an expensive book or you want it, don’t send it down as it may get lost. Don’t send a lot of books down as I will have very little room to put them when I move from here which I hope wont be for long.\nIts getting on for dinner time now and I can here the cutlery rattling. I expect it will be fish again. I’m quite ready for it as I’ve got my apetite back again now.\nGive my love to Mum, Rene, & Tim and cheerio dear.\nYours, \nBern\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

It was very good indeed and I have just finished it: Infact I’m rather late starting my letter writing today owing to the fact that I was ingrossed in it.\nI have been removed from my ward now into the big ward, presumable because they have only just got a vacant bed in here. I guessed there was some reason for putting me in a private ward as the army wouldn’t pay extra for my comfort. Its not so good in here as my bed is almost against a door and I have no direct neighbours. Also the beds are farther apart and it was very nice indeed with only the four of us in that small room. Being private patients we almost got more private attention.\nI was very supprised yesterday when I had a visitor, a cousin of mine who lives at Gillingham. I have not seen her for about 4 years and dad dropped her a line and asked if she would mind dropping in to see me. He never said anything to me so I was of course suprised when she came in as I hadn’t given it a thought myself. She comes from Burnham on Crouch and as soon as she came in she said \"that man next to you is Mr Williams who comes from Burnham\" and she was right! What a small world this is. He didn’t know her but knew my uncle quite well. He is my \"bollege\" who is suffering from the same complaint.\nShe is comming to see me next Wednesday again. I don’t think I’ll be gone then. When I do leave here I’ll try and get a few days leave as I shan’t be in much condition for duty unless they give me a few days convelesent.\nPlease don’t send me any more cigarettes dear as I can get them from the paper man who comes round morning and evening.\nI’ve missed the post now so I’ll have to tackle one of the nurses to post them when they go off duty.\nThey’re very nice nurses here too if you don’t mind me saying so.\nI shall take good care of the book and will return it as soon as I can, maybe in person.\nI hope every one at home is alright and also hope you wont round and saw mum as you said in your letter.\nI have no more news for now dear so bye bye darling I’m always thinking of you.\nYours,\nBern\n"

The sun is streaming through the windows here making me wish I was outside of this place instead of being a prisoner in bed. Its not the amount of time which counts now when writing a letter but the amount of stuff to fill them with. In here its the same old routine every day of waking up, having a cup of tea, washing, bed made, breakfast, then looking forward to dinner, after dinner looking forward to tea, after tea to supper, and so to sleep and it just goes on and on like a worn out record. I have a chap who is allowed to get up during the day time who comes and sits with me and is quite good company.\nYes dear, having my appetite back is a good sign but its also too good realy as I have no filling foods much as fish, although very nice, doen’t give you that pleasent full feeling. I could just about enjoy a nice big dinner now but I would probably feel some bad effects afterwards.\nI hope that letter to Bucks was OK as I rushed it and didn’t have time to read it through as the chap was just going out who posted the letters in the other ward.\nI’m glad my mother looks better than she did before and Ken is still on with his diet so this jaunders seems rather a slow job. The doctor has just been round and said I’ve still a slight tint in my eyes. The eye is the first place that is discoloured and the last place to go from.\nI should imagine that Rene has had quite a bit of enjoyment out of my dafodil colour so tell her to beware when I come home. I’ll buy a 6lb tin of best outdoor yellow paint that makers claim wont come off with anything less than a blowlamp, and tip it over her head. By the way, you’re not sergesting that I looked like a dishonourable chinaman are you? According to most fiction books a chinaman when speaking in broken (or unbroken) English always says ‘honourable’ about 20 times in every sentence.\nI’ll come home next time with a beautiful moustache as its a good time to grow one now I’m in here. A real bushy one with waxed ends which protrude about 3\" each side.\nWhile I have been writing I have lost my companion who has shifted to the other end of the ward and the man who was there went home this morning.\nI’m attempting to write six pages this morning but goodnes knows where the rest of this page is comming from. I think I’ll write my name large and in full, that aught to fill it up.\nA nurse has just come and told me my \"colleague\" wants to know how I’m getting on and whether I’m up yet. Hes getting jealous in case I get up before him!\nGive my love to mum, Rene, and Tim, I can guess what Renes remark will be. Bye bye\nYours,\nBern\n"

Well if you did you made a mistake. You speak as though he spent his last halfpenny on you, he can afford it more than you can. You make me laugh at times.\nGoodness knows what I’m going to write about but I’ll try and wear some of this pencil down at least.\nThe weather is grand this morning, with the sun shining through the open windows which to my suprise Freddie (the chap in the corner) has not yet closed. He must either feel too lazy to get up (and he is lazy too) or has changed his mind about fresh air which I dout very much. He has shut the only one within his reach but maybe the book is he reading has stopped him from advancing any further than that.\nOne of the books mum brought up called I believe \"Britains Deadly Enemy\" by William Le Queux (I’ve lent it to my colleague so can’t be sure of the name) I thought would be very interesting so started reading it first. It started out about the war and how it would be a hard fight before we eventually came to the victory and went on about the terrible price racket that should be stopped and it wasn’t until I had got about 10 pages into it that it was the last war and not this one that he was writing about. He started talking about Zepo and different people who were connected with the 1914-18 war. It was pretty dry so I skipped alot that did not interest me. If it was published in the last war, its a wonder they allowed him to print it with the different things that he mentioned in it.\nWe have a wounded pilot in here or rather in Dean Stores ward that I was in. Hes an american who flies one of those Lancasters and got hit over france and made a crash landing near here quite successfully and none of the crew got hurt but he had a piece of cannon shell in his leg which he collected in france during a scrap. They say it sounds very strange in there with my ‘colleague’ whos a bit of a twerp saying \"By jove old man, thats topping\" and the american with \"Yeer. Sure thing, bud.\"\nWell this is where I’m stumped. I dona ken what to write so I’ll descripe what nothing is if I may.\nNothing is a thing which is not. If an object is there and then taken away it leaves nothing unless some other object is there. Sometimes the word is misused. A so called empty bottle may not be empty (or have nothing in it) because it contains air. Should there be a vacuum inside the bottle, it truly has nothing in it. Now therefore, I hope I have made it plain to you what Nothing to write about is. Its a vacuum inside an empty bottle:\nNow I’ve written have a page on tripe, I find I’ve still the problem of filling up another page and if I go on at this rate I shall never finish. So I’d better pack up before I go completely crackers.\nGive my love to Mum, Rene, and Tim and Bye Bye\nYours,\nBern\n"

Sorry I don’t write every day dear but its hard enough to find anything to put in them as it is. I’d write 2 a day if there was anything to write about.\nAs you can see, I have not left Dartmoor yet although I have been expecting it any day. I recone I’ll be here over the weekend now but they may take it into their head to clear me out this afternoon or tomorrow. Hospitals are funny places. I think that blood test couldn’t have been so satisfactory as it should have been.\nThat american airman whom I spoke of in a previous letter is getting a bit fed up in the private ward with only an old chap with him so yesterday afternoon I passed talking to him. Hes a jolly decent chap, not like so many of the americans who brag their heads off. Rather quiet sort of chap. He showed me the leggings of his flying suit which was punctured all over one leg by the flying pieces of shell but only one piece had enough force to go through it and there was the hole where it penetrated into his led. Hes been here 18 months now. (England I mean)\nI found out yesterday about that other army chap in here with his leg cut off. I don’t know if you noticed him, he had it blown off in africa. I don’t suppose you would notice as he would be in bed. \nYes, Louie did come on Wednesday and brought me the shaving soap.\nCharlie is getting very nosy about me isn’t he? Maybe he is considering giving me his job after the war. Are you frightened he may trip you up about when I came home on leave?\nI have not received the cigs yet but thank you all the same dear, though you shouldn’t have done it. \"Yet didn’ orta dun it\"\nOur Fred shut all the windows the nurse opened this morning as usual but we’ve been caught now. They got a long window pole and opened all the windows that run all along the top and we can’t reach them. Its worse than having the windows open.\nMy bed is now in the middle of the ward as a chap who was in the middle had an operation yesterday and they needed his bed against the wall to plug the bed warmer in to light. As I’m up all day they left him there. He only had his tonsils out. Hes about 14 I should imagine.\nIts a lovely day again here and looks as though the summer is well on the way. Its amazing how the weather has changed since I first climbed into bed a fortnight ago.\nWell, I have nothing more that I can think of so I’ll have to pack up. Give my love to Mum, Rene, + Tim.\nBye bye,\nYours,\nBern\n"

It doesn’t look as though I shall be going for a few days either as they are going to issue me with blues so that I can go out. Saturday morning they took me up to a store room upstairs to get fitted out but the storeman (or who ever it is) was away. I would have been able to have gone out Saturday if I had got them. The other army chap is allowed out from one till six every day. It will be a bit better if I can get out, I’ll visit Louie if its humanly possible. \nAnyway, I’ve arranged to go and see her on Thursday when Will will be home early owing to him going on firewatching. As a rule he doesn’t get home to 7:30 which is too late for me to see him.\nMy Grandmother stayed at Louies’ this week-end so that she could come and see me but owing to me saying that 10 to 1 I shouldn’t be here she never troubled to get here to time and never arrived till nearly half passed three. I have been shifted (as I believe I told you) into the middle of the room and when they got here Louie of course looked to where I had been before and although it is only a few feet from where I am now, she never saw me. I waved and immediately they came walking up the ward as though they saw me. A couple of nurses stood talking at the bottom of my bed and Louie asked if I was there.\nI’m pretty steady on my pins now and feel as well as ever but I believed a walk will soon tire me out. They lined up all the flowers on my locker last night (which visitors had brought in) and said they’d brought them ready for when I passed out.\nI gave Renes book to them yesterday to take back with her when she goes home today. I expect she’ll give it to mum.\nThese socks are grand that you knitted darling. I gave Louie the others as they were collecting more holes than is necessary for a pair of socks to have. If you remember I collected your parcel just before leaving the fort and therefore brought it with me. As a matter of fact I opened it in the ambulance.\nI heard that there were quite a lot of rotten eggs floating about on Friday night arround you dear. I’m glad you’re safe anyway. My \"private detective\" went round and made sure and reported to me yesterday. I hear me old school has suffered from the raid. Damn careless some of theese german airmen aren’t they?\nIts too early yet to say what the weather is or will be like today as its only 10:30 (according to the sun its only 8:30). It looks dismal just now but I expect it will liven up soon.\nWell darling I hope you’ve no more colds or anything, and that the rest are all the same. Give my love to one and all (the one being yourself darling).\nBye bye,\nYours,\nBern\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nGnr. B Shepherd\nYantlet Det\nGrain Fort\nIsle of Grain\nKent\n\nDearest,\nJust a few lines to let you know of my departure from the hospital. I left there at 3 o’clock in the afternoon and came back here by bus from Chatham. I’m sorry I can’t write very much tonight as I have very little time and I must write to mum and also Louie whom I arranged to go and see on Thursday as I thought I’d be in blues by then. I don’t feel too bad but am a bit shakey on my legs. I am trying to get some sick leave but don’t yet know the result. Don’t bank on me coming home for goodness sake! There was an ensa show on here tonight and that is the reason for not having much time tonight. It was pretty good too.\nI recieved your letter yesterday, thank you dear, I have it tucked away so I’m afraid I can’t answer it just now. I don’t think there was anything very important so it can wait till I write next.\nIt was grand coming down here by bus today as it was almost like a summers day and its a decent run down from there.\nI have not recieved those cigarettes that you spoke of in last weeks letter. They must have got lost in the post, unless you decided not to post them as I was uncertain as to when I was leaving.\nWell dear, I must close now and please get the leave idea out of your head. In your letter to me you spoke of expecting me any time but just remember I don’t get my leave till April, then should I turn up (which I don’t think I will) you’ll be suprised. Thats what I do anyway and I find it sucessful.\nGive my love to Mum, Rene, and Tim and goodnight darling,\nYours,\nBern\n"

B Shepherd\nYantlet Det\nGrain Fort\nIsle of Grain\nKent\n\nDearest,\nI’ve arrived safely back in the \"dear ol’ home\" again, I got in soon after nine after a nice long walk from Stoke. Three cars passed me one the way but they were going in the wrong direction. Please excuse the mess at the top as I’m not used to writing with ink and its a new nib and played a few tricks with me. The parcels and letters were all here when I arrived which you and mum sent before I came home.\nThank you very much for the cigarettes, paper and envelopes. I’m glad you wrote those letters that I didn’t recieve in time dear as I enjoyed them this morning when I read them. They weren’t a waste of time.\nI thought about you this morning dearest, just before dinner when you was in the dentists. I hope you had them out today darling as it will be all over by now. I don’t suppose you’ll feel too grand just now but hope that you feel OK by the time you recieve this.\nThank you dear for the lovely time we had together. I don’t know what it would be without you dear, I certainly wouldn’t have enjoyed my leave so much without you. I’m afraid I can’t give you the date of when I come on leave again, although the official list is up and I am down for May 5th. I was told that it had been shifted back though as it puts some others back a fortnight late. Its only fair I suppose to let those go first.\nThe weather has been better today than yesterday when we wanted to go out but its been very dull and looked like rain practically all day. It was a pity it wasn’t fine on Friday.\nI’m glad you went round to mums after coming from me as I know you would have only sat and thought about that Tilbury train all the evening and it isn’t very pleasant in a house on your own. Go round to mums anytime you’re on your own darling and go and see her sometimes as she realy does want to see you and I should like you to go of a weekend if your not doing anything. You could go round to tea and they’d love to see you! \nI must write to mum so I’ll close now darling.Give my love to mum, Rene, and Tim and leave the biggest half for your self.\nGoodnight darling,\nYours for ever,\nBern\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nGnr. B Shepherd\nYantlet Det\nGrain Fort\nIsle of Grain\nKent\n\nDearest,\nThank you very much for your letter darling so glad you have had your teeth out and when you’ve had those others filled you’ll be able to eat sweets in comfort. That will be a change for you. I hope Warren never said anything about you having the extra day off, he can’t say very much realy.\nI’m sorry I was so long in writing when I got down here but although I wrote it on Saturday it was not posted until Monday morning as theres no post on Sundays. I expect you were wondering what was the matter.\nI was on duty Sunday night and shall also be on again tomorrow. I was glad I wasn’t on tonight as there was an ensa show on. It was pretty good too and one of the best I’ve seen. Some of theese shows are dry and wish afterwards that I hadn’t done but this was a roar the whole way through. They hold the shows in the village hall just outside the fort and quite alot of the villagers come to it as well.\nThe weather has been rather on the dull side today but havent had this afternoon off as there was a League match on. We now only have to beat one more battery team and we’ll be on top. Todays match was real good to watch. We won 4-1 but it was hard play all the way. There was a strong wind blowing and in the first half we were playing with the wind and only scored one goal which they had to fight hard for. In the second half, with the wind against them, they ran the other team off their feet. What a lark.\nI didn’t write on both sides of this paper before as I thought the ink would show through but on experimenting I find it doesn’t. If I only write on one side it looks as though I’m writing more than I am. Nothing of importance gas happened during the past few days so I have very little news to tell you darling. The fighting in Lybia seems to be going even better than could be imagined. We don’t get very much news here with no wireless and only 1 paper a week but get a rough idea from what chaps, that do here it, tell us. I heard the news yesterday morning as I was on shift and there is a wireless down there but its no use trying to listen to the NAAFI one as theres to much noise and its only a midget and not much good at that. Sometimes we hear the one in the cafe we pop in sometimes on the way to Yantlet but we only go there by leaving pretty early.\nI did leave my comb behind but luckily I have another so I didn’t worry about it. Dad sent me it down this morning.\nI will close now darling give my love to Mum, Rene and Tim.\nGoodnight dear,\nYours,\nBern\n"

B Shepherd\nYantlet Detach\nGrain Fort\nIsle of Grain\nKent\n\nDearest Kath,\nThank you for Tuesdays letter dear and also the stamps.\nGlad you spent a good evening round home last Friday even though you lost the card game. What did you play? If you like going to see mum why not go round every week, for, as I’ve told you before, she loves you to go round. It makes a change for her as well as you. You could either go when ever you’ve nothing to do or else make arrangements with her. She wont mind in the least.\nI said in my letter about the leave queerie that altho’ on the offical list it said May 5th I was told by the bombard’ that they were shifting it back as some of the chaps behind me were a fortnight late with their leave and going to be moved up into my place. Do you get it now dear? Actually, its not May 5th, its 11th as I read it wrong but I have not been shifted so I take it as a false alarm. If I have it on May 11th I should be due for the next one in August as you say in your letter but I’m afraid I can give no dates.\nThere was a film on today here at the fort - \"Dangerous moonlight\". I don’t know whether you saw it but it was terrible. We saw it this afternoon during the armys time so it didn’t matter so much. You see, there was an education film to be shown this afternoon and the big film should have been shown tonight but the camera operator asked if it couldn’t be shown this afternoon after the education film and the officer gave his consent.\nThe projectors are beautiful things and are just the same as used in an ordinary cinema. The whole lot cost close on £7000. I helped to rig it up this morning and I had quite a decco at it. One of the operators is a small film star. He has been on quite a lot of Ministry of Informat. Films. He was in a film of Gert and Daisys called ‘A Lovely Weekend’. Since he was called up he has only been on M.O.I. films. He knows all the Yauntlet croud so he was in our room most of the time he was here. He is a real comedian. Makes you laugh the whole time and doesn’t care a damn for anyone. He calls himself Jerry Rex on the films.\nWell darling its nearly a week now since I came back from leave but I swear this week was longer than the one before. Those seven days went like a M.E.110 with a spitfire on its tail.\nI can’t grumble realy though as I’m having quite a good time here and am settled down as everyone has to when they’ve been on leave.\nWell I will close now darling as I must write two more letters and I don’t want to get writers cramp.\nGive my love to Irene, Mum, and Tim and also that little girl at Bucks called Kath or rather Miss Joyner. So with that I say T.T.F.N. (Ta Ta for now)\nYours for ever,\nBern\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nGnr. B Shepherd\nYantlet Det\nGrain Fort\nIsle of Grain\n\nDarling,\nJust a few lines to let you know I’m still alive and waiting for the day when I can come back for good. Thank you for Thursdays letter dear which the postman kindly brought me this morning.\nSorry there was nothing in my previous letter to answer. Its a bit of a job thinking what to put in it sometimes, isn’t it? What I usually do is write down any old thing (same as I’m doing now) and that generally starts the engine going’.\nVery considerable of Warren to let you have your holiday when I come home. It just bears out what I always say - \"He ain’t a bad old stick\" and you can’t say much after that rise he got you. \nHaving teeth filled isn’t such a very terrible operation as long as you keep hold of your nerves. I’ve had quite a lot filled (inside and outside the army) and I can’t say that it realy hurts much, its just a funny sensation.\nWe had an officer down here on Thursday night to inspect the operation of the lights. We were the whole day before cleaning up for him which was quite unnecessary as everything was spit and span before we started. It stands to reason that if half of us are down there every day it doesn’t get much chance to get dirty. This officer kept picking on small faults but he never found much wrong. I believe he was satisfied.\nThen friday the O.C gave us a suprise visit and we all had to parade in full service marching order for him to inspect us. He also had a nose round the rooms and then hopped it. He never said anything was wrong.\nI am on duty tomorrow night. I should have been on tonight but I swapped over with one of the other boys.\nBy the way dear have Bucks got any pen nibs to spare? Don’t worry if they havent as can ask Claude, he may get some as they never seem to do much in his place so they wouldn’t wear their nibs out. \nI suppose I’d better get my bed down now ready for a drop of sleep. Its been a very nice day for Saturday so we can’t grumble. We watched a washout match between a sloppy team from the fort and another battery team. We lost (or rather the fort lost) 6-2. It was sickening to watch but being a nice afternoon it didn’t matter so much.\nI believe I’ve won part of the football that we run in the Yantlet croud. It comes to about 11 shillings but I think I’m sharing it with someone so it’ll only come to 5/6. Still its better than nothing.\nI will close now darling. Give my love to everyone and don’t forget to go round and see mum sometimes.\nBye bye\nYours, true till the last,\nBern\nPS. --- -.-- doesn’t stand for MY\nB.\nXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nGnr. B Shepherd\nYantlet Det\nGrain Fort\nIsle of Grain\nKent\n\nDearest Kath,\nThank you very much for the lovely long letter which I got this morning. Its funny how you can sometimes find a ton to write about and others its absolutely imposible to think of a single thing.\nAs a matter of fact dear I was going to tell you to have your holiday with my next leave and make sure of it if you possibly could. Its a long way yet to August or September and many things may happen between now and then.\n‘Dangerous Moonlight’ was tripe. There was no tale to it (not what I call a tale), nothing thrilling or interesting, infact to me it was just a lot of people walking about on the screen with a couple falling in love and having a few rows. The bit I liked best was the air scrap he had which lasted about one minute and the music.\nIf I (or when I) get embarkation leave I’ll tell you as soon as I get the change. I think its worse to just slip away with out saying. I’ll let you know right enough dear. I hope you havent got it into your head that I shan’t go abroad as I’m in the coast RA as it would make it a lot worse if I did go. Remember I’m A1 and young.\nGravesend is not a restricted area as far as I know. No its not (I’ve just asked). I’ve got a disappointment though as he can’t let one go to gravesend for Easter without the others doing the same. Well thats the excuse he made. I was on with him last night you see so I asked him. He said he thinks we’ll get Monday off if nothing turns up.\nI have been on 2 nights running here, Sunday night and Monday. This was because I changed with Arthur (one of the boys) with Sunday instead of Saturday as he was going on leave on a Sunday and another chap, Jack, had to go and see a specialist at Woolich so I had to take his place on Monday night. Jacks nose started bleeding a week or so ago and kept bleeding on and off ever since. On Sunday morning (he was at the plant, been on all night) it bled so much that they had to fetch an ambulance to bring him back to the fort where the M.O. plugged it. At Woolich they did something to it and said that if it didn’t bleed for another two days it would never bleed again. So he seems OK again now.\nI’m writing this letter in the morning for, being on last night, I didn’t have to go down the plant on maintainance.\nWhat a wind there was last night and this morning. Up in our DS which is high in the air, the wind was howling \"like the wind\" (Joke No. 1 over) and going outside was murder. It has stopped now and the sun is shining fine.\nI’ve just noticed that I’ve put the wrong day on the top of this letter but I shan’t cross it out as there is quite enough ‘crossings out’ on theese few sheets. It should be Tuesday. The only day I’m interested in down here is Friday.\nI will close now dear as \"dinner is served, my lady\" or rather \"come ‘n get it\"\nGive my love to them all at No. 59.\nCheerio dearest,\nYours,\nxxxxxxxxxx Bern xxxxxxxxxx\n"

I hear she wasn’t feeling up to standard according to Claudes letter that I got this morning. I bet old Warren doesn’t feel up to standard either, I can imagine him hopping arround shouting for everbody to bring him this, that and even the other. A footballer, eh? West-ham or Arsenal? I suppose he plays for the S.D.L. (the slave-drivers league)\nSo they’re making you earn your extra 5/- now are they? I know quite a lot about T.C. as we had quite a deal to do with it at the other firm. I used to like the work there as you had to use your brains and had a very interesting tho’ more responsible job. It wasn’t like a mass production mashine as it is at Bucks.\nWe went duck-egg hunting on Tuesday afternoon, \"Dusty\" and I, and for 20 eggs between us. Quite a few of the others went out as well but weren’t so fortunate. We shared them out with the others and had them for tea.\nWe had a spring tide up here this week which has flooded the enterance to the plant. This afternoon we’ve been trying to make a path through the hugh pond with the earth but I don’t think it will be very sucessful. It’ll sink in next to no time.\nYou don’t know how to take this blinin’ weather do you? If your weather is the same as mine its not been too good these last 3 days but before that on Saturday & Sunday it was wonderful.\nWell dear I will close now, hoping your as well as what I am.\nGive my love as per usual (or unusual) and look after yourself darling.\nYours,\nBern\n x x\n x x x x\n x x\nx x\n x x\n x x x x\n x x\n"

I’m not particular what sort of nibs I use as long as they’ll make a mark on the paper.\nYou certainly seem in a rotten mood by the start of the letter. Warren must be working you hard.\nI should wash the idea of seeing me at Easter out of your head darling. If I should manage to be able to get to Gravesend I’ll let you know. Till then forget it. \nI’m afraid I’ve mislaid or lost your Fridays letter where you ask me about the argument between Dennis and you two. It just shows you how girls will argue about something they know nothing about. Its a blinkin’ ackward question to answer and I don’t agree with either you or Dennis. A man doesn’t feel it so much as a woman (this is only my own idea) but I shouldn’t say he doesn’t give her first place in his heart. Realy can’t say for certain can I? I don’t know what a womans feelings are.\nI am going to try and get a 24 hours next weekend. Most probably Saturday, I’ll get it sometime this week. It wont be Friday (payday) or Sunday as I should be in duty and I’m going to have a good try for Saturday as you’ll be home in the afternoon. I’ll let you know definately later on.\nWe’ve been working hard on our afternoon off today. A rowing boat has been washed ashore about half a mile from Yantlet, rather worse for smashing up against the rocks. We managed to float it with the aid of some petrol tins and float it down the Yantlet by the dykes that run along there. A carpenter here in the Detachment is going to try and repair it although I myself and several others, think it is impossible. The back of it is smashed right in.\nIt is lovely here today as I expect it is at home. I hope it is like this when I get my leave. It’ll be grand. This weather changes so much doesn’t it now.\nI must close now dear so bye bye darling. Give my love to everyone.\nYours for ever,\nBern\n"

The C.O. of the battery here in the fort came to inspect them and we were collared to clean the cookhouse & naafi. We were working till 11 o’clock. The night before that I was on duty.\nThank you for Saturdays lovely long letter dear. There seems nothing to answer in the letter except that \"puzzle\" of \"--- -.-- MY\". The simple answer being that you put --- -.-- for \"my\" in one of your letters to me. Sorry if I make you puzzle your brain out for nothing, as I should have explained it better.\nI am hoping to be home for 24 hr on Saturday. Theres nothing definate but it’ll be OK as long as I’m not on shift. I shan’t know whether I am on duty on Saturday untill Friday so I can’t warn you. I expect I’ll turn up like a bad penny anyway.\nIts been grand down here theese last two days. Just like a holiday. Working out in the fields. We have started a garden down the plant and are now digging all the terf in. Its pretty tough going just now but once we get it all dug it will be O.K. Its a fair size but we have plenty of us to do it.\nI am writing this afternoon off as there is nothing to do here. Some of them have gone to Yantlet as its nice out there in the sun but I had this letter to write and couldn’t borrow a bike so stopped here.\nI got 5/- shillings from Bucks yesterday which came in very handy indeed. What with the smokes and drinks going up it looks as though I shall have to cut down a bit to balance my budget. I think I’ll put in for a rise!\nMy leave still stands at May 11 so expect me home in 4 weeks time yesterday. (sounds a bit funny doesn’t it?) Have you decided to have your weeks holiday then or wait for the next?\nI can’t think of anything more to say just now so I’ll pack up untill my next and send a word to Bucks for the 5/-.\nExpect me on Saturday and I’ll ring the office during the morning if I come home but I wont if I don’t for if I can’t how can I?\nBye bye for 3 days (we hope) darling, I hope I don’t disappoint you\nYours for ever,\nBern\n"

I took the accordian down and we had a sing song during the breaks. I enjoyed it and am going again tomorrow.\nThere is an ensa show on tonight here so I havent much time for writing now. \nWe didn’t get back from the Outing until 5:30.\nStill, in another 11 or so days I shall be home again. Then a fortnight after that is my 9 days and also your weeks holiday. If its weather like this we shall be out most of the time which will do you quite a bit of good.

Still, theres no harm in trying.\nSorry it was such a short letter last time but its dificult to think of a thing to write about theese days isn’t it? I think theres less to write about now than ever since I first came in the army. Letter writing will soon be getting a problem.\nI hope you have enjoyed the holiday. We didn’t do much yesterday, well theres nothing to do and except for watching a match this afternoon and having a bath we’ve done no more today. I am on duty tonight.\nThe old accorian is still going strong, I don’t know about being an expert but I should improve quite a bit as I’m playing it a lot. The other chap has given me some tips. It sounds a lot better though in a bigger room or in the open. I think the rooms are too small for it at home.\nThe weather seems alright again now, although there is a bit of wind about.

Although so say nothing in the letter, I know you were disappointed by not receiving a letter from me on Saturday. I’m sorry dear but I could not have possibly caught Friday afternoons post except by only writing a few lines and that would have disappointed you even more. \nYes, I got the money from Bucks yesterday and have acknowledged it which I suppose you know. I hope the letter was O.K. Sometimes I feel I don’t put enough in them, its ackward really as they are sort of semi-business letters. Yes, it does seem strange \"Dear Shep\". Its funny but calling you Kath seemed to come quite natural right from the start.\nI’ve just been and had my hair cut which I suppose you would grumble at if you were here.\nI hope you enjoyed the cricket OK on Sunday.\nThis is funny weather we’re having lately, isn’t it? It was raining a minute ago and now the sun is shining. Yesterday was really terrible, rain and cold & windy. We didn’t visit Yantlet yesterday afternoon as it was raining so hard. We did some blancoing instead. I hate that job. \nI havent realy very much more to write dear but I’m not giving in yet as this letter doesn’t though its had much dinner.\nWe got some cockles out the mud last time I was on, and they were lovely. They are a dickens of a job to get though as the tide doesn’t go out until 10 o’clock and they are quite a bit out, in the thick mud. One of the boys nearly fell over in the mud. He’d have known it if he had!\nI’ll try and get a 24 hr in about the middle of next week, depending upon which days I’m on duty. I’m on tomorrow night on my old job in the DS, soon I shan’t know what I’m supposed to be.\nWell darling, I must close now untill I write again which wont be very long, and it wont be very long before I shall be seeing you again for a few hours dear, so we’re pretty lucky don’t you think?\nGive my love out as per usual dearest but don’t forget that everyone is rationed except you.\nThank you for the song darling I only wish I were there to tell you how much I mean those words for you dearest.\nGood night my love\nIn \nJam\nYours for eternity\nBern\n\nxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxx\n"

I hope you enjoyed yourself. Its a pity I’m not down at Canvey instead of this City of Grain.\nI don’t realy know why I’m writing this as I should be home before you get this letter. It’ll be either tomorrow or Thursday. I’ll ring you when I get home for certain (I hope). I’ve run out of excuses.\nI’ve never heard of \"Old Uncle Jerry\" before, hes a new one to me. It puzzled me at first as I thought you meant the Huns.\nWe had yesterday afternoon off. We all spent it bed getting rid of the after effects of the holiday. I am on tonight so I have the afternoon off. I shall catch the 3:30 post and it should arrive home in the morning.\nAt dinner today we were talking to a chap who had come over from Sheerness for the day, and found he could play an accordian so he had a go on Paddys organ. He was really hot on it too. The only thing wrong was that he was used to a big one and kept running off the key board. He plays music too. When I come home I’m getting that book of songs to bring back as its a bit of a job thinking of the tunes to play.\nI believe I’m stumped now, I wouldn’t be much good for a newspaper bloke. Not down here anyway. Still, I hope to be home by the time you read this.\nGive my love to mum, Rene, Tim if I don’t see them first.\nBye bye darling.\nYours for ever\nBern\n"

It’ll turn up like a bad penny I don’t doubt.\nI got back safely yesterday and didn’t have to walk from the station as a van happened to come up just as I came from the station. I believe I should have caught the Gravesend train alright if I had caught the 8:30 from Barking as I had ¾ of an hour wait at Gravesend. I’ll try it next time. I had to visit the \"browned off water cafe\" again.\nI was on duty last night so I missed half of the ensa show that was here. What I did see was OK though.\nI hope this weather clears up before I come home again. Its been terrible here and I expect its the same at home. Its turned even colder than ever today, soon to be putting the winter woolies on again. I thought I’d put my red flannel away for 6 months.\nYou’ll find 10/- inside towards the tickets dear I meant to have told mum to lend me some to give you but I forgot all about it. Nevermind I got paid yesterday. I’ll square up with you when I come home. Don’t think I’m broke dear I’ve plenty to carry on the week and will have quite a bit when I come home in a fortnight time.\nThe sun is beginning to shine now so perhaps its going to change.\nTheres nothing more I can think of scribbling about darling. Harry Meek has just told me to give you his love.\nBye bye dear\nYours\nBern\n"

I’m glad you had plenty of time to catch your train after leaving me. The Trollies run pretty frequent in the mornings don’t they?\nI believe I told you that I got a lift from Stoke so I didn’t get wet. I’d have been a soaking wreck if I’d have walked it. A chap here cycled back on Saturday and got soaked through to the skin so goodness knows what I’d have been like.\nYes, I like Tommy Trinder myself dear and if several people have said its OK it suits me down to the ground. I shall be home on the 11th all being well as the last chaps went on Sunday which brings them back on the 11th. Its come on me so suddenly that I can hardly believe another week will bring it here.\nI’m afraid it is Tuesday night now dear as I was interupted yesterday. As I was on duty last night I should have had the afternoon off, buy just as I had settled down to writing this letter we were all packed off to Yantlet to smarten up the plant as the O.C. was coming today to inspect. He came this morning. We got the barrack rooms all spit & span and he never even put his nose inside the fort.\nThere was another ensa show on here tonight but it had been here about a month ago so most of us had seen it. It was a good show though.\nI don’t know about your part of the globe but it isn’t to warm round here. The sun has been shining all day but the wind has been terrible. Its too lazy to go round you.\nI’m afraid I can think of no more to say dear, so I shall have to pack up.\nGive my love to 59 and I’ll be seeing you in a weeks time.\nGoodnight dearest\nYours for ever\nBern \n"

I don’t think worms eat diamonds, rubies, or gold though, do they?\nI did always did say your *!@*!*? Trains weren’t any good didn’t I? Fancy a steam train, of all the things, breaking down. There isn’t very much wrong with those things unless they forget to put the water in, then the sparkes would fly OK. You should go by electric as they always break down two or three times a week and you’re prepared for it.\nI suppose you are having your holiday from Thursday till Wednesday dear. Its a pity the weather doesn’t show us a leg and show us a few fine days. It hasn’t been bad after about Tuesday. As the wind has dropped I suppose it is the same at home. I was on duty last night and was it cold this morning when we came back. It was a good job I had a bike, I didn’t fancy walking in it.\nWhats on at the Hip next week? If its good would you get tickets? Theres a grand show on here on Saturday with all big stars in it. They are all in the army. I’m off duty too so I’ll be there alright.\nSee the paper I’m using, its a free issue from the naffi. We get some every time we go in there and I think it’ll keep me going. It means I shall not have to buy any more.\nWell the times getting on darling, so I’ll have to pack up. I’ll be seeing you in 5 short days dear, it isn’t long is it?\nYours for ever & ever,\nBern\n"

It is now 1:30 and we start work at two o’clock.\nThank you so much for the lovely time I’ve had the last 10 days. Its certainly the best leave I’ve had and I don’t think I’ve ever enjoyed myself so much before. It was wonderful. I realy felt terrible on that station yesterday evening. I hope I didn’t show it, and that train journey to Tilbury was like a nightmare. I felt a bit better after I had crossed the ferry and got to the station. I got there at ten past eight and the train didn’t go before ten to nine so I passed most of the time in the usual cafe. I got in to the fort just at half past 10.\nI hope you had plenty of work today darling as it would keep your mind from wandering away. Unluckily I have had very little to do and I’ve been in Ilford most of the time. I do hope they havent kept inquiring how I am, although I suppose they have. I didn’t realise fully untill yesterday afternoon that it was nearing the end of my leave, it seemed too good to vanish so quickly by that guard on the train waving his arm. Still, what would leaves me like darling if I hadn’t got you. We can still have pleasent memories of the past week and, better still, thoughts of my next one in twelve weeks time.\nEverything is about the same back here and I am on duty tonight as I expected. It must have been Yantley that we could see from Canvey on Tuesday as I forgot that the sea wall would hide the engine room and huts that we were looking for.\nThe weather is still holding out isn’t it dear? I thought that maybe it would change as soon as I got back just as it did when I came home. I hope it has come to stay now anyway.\nI can’t think of any think to write about dear, so I’m afraid I must close.\nGive my love to mum, Rene, Tim\nBye bye my darling,\nJust yours,\nBern\n"

I’m glad you didn’t have to wait long for a bus home.\nAt 9 o’clock on Thursday while you were writing that letter dear I was on the iron road to Stoke and thinking of you the whole way down. Yes, my thoughts were all over the place, Canvey, Chingford, Wanstead, Kew Grds and Ilford, and you were there every time.\nNo, Arthur doesn’t want those tickets as his wife has written and told him she will write for some so thats all settled. His wife didn’t know that i was going to get any.\nThey came and dragged me down the plant last night at close on midnight as they wanted a signaller and there wasn’t one on duty. So one of the blokes had to cycle back and getch me and was it dark? When I got there I wasn’t wanted. What a game.\nI am now learning to be a search light operator so that I can operate a lamp. I know a bit about them and am going on with one of the S.L.O.s tonight to show me the \"ropes\". I fancy this job alot better than up in the DS. Its interesting.\nI shall be able to put back most of the money I drew out for my leave dear, as I have been informed that I have £2 credit to draw. Best to draw it when you can or you might not get it.\nI can’t think of any more to say for the present darling so I’m afraid I must close although I feel like writing for ever. Roll on Mr Time untill once more we don’t just have to pretend we are in each others arms. What a lot of wasted time there is.\nOurs fathers and mothers were just the same and I suppose it will go on just the same until the world gets civilized enough to stop these sickening wars. I shall not say any more though dear as it was this war which brought us together wasn’t it? I should not have worked at Muck & Hickmans if it wasn’t for that.\nCheerio darling, give my love to all at 59 and so Bye Bye, yours for ever, Bern\n"

I was on duty last night so it was impossible to answer it then.\nThe new leave list has gone up dear and my next leave is on August the 8th so we have plenty of time to think up an excuse for you even if we havent the brains. Seriously though darling I’m scared stiff that you’ll get into a row if you ain’t careful. I shouldn’t like that as I would feel it was my fault. We’ll have to get a waterproof alibi with an air-tight casing round it.\nI’m very sorry to hear you are not very well darling. Good job it was not a fortnight sooner as it would have upset the run of things a bit. You would most certianly not have laid on that grass then. I was wondering whether that had anything to do with it. I do hope that ‘King of Colds’ has gone back to his kingdom. Tell Mrs Fountain I’m sorry to hear about her husband being torpedoed but am very glad he has managed to strike back to safety. Don’t worry about me dearest, nothing will ever happen to me, I’m a Shepherd and God will look after me. If anything did ever happen to me darling I should want you to be brave and - well just as you are now dear. You’ll promise wont you?\nI’ve been puzzling my brain as to what gave you the idea I had no paper? By the way, thank you for the paper dear. I can’t remember saying I was short and if I did I wasn’t exactly telling the truth. I admit I’ve only 3 envelopes but the paper should last another week or so, that is if I don’t write a volumn tonight. I feel like it.\nHasn’t Ella get her RA chap to share her holiday with or does he live (or rather is his home) along way from Ilford. It can’t be though can it if we saw his sister at the station?\nI’m glad in a way that I didn’t see Pike on my leave dear. I enjoyed myself to the utmost, so what else could a chap want.\nYes, my credit came through today, I have £2.1.9½. Goodness knows where it came from, unless it was while I was in hospital. The ½d makes me laugh.\nThe weather has been grand down here today and it was real good down the plant this afternoon doing a spot of gardening. The garden is a picture to see now with everythink shooting up in dead straight rows. Our gardener sure knows his job. We have potatoes, lettice, carrots, onions, radish, tomatoes, marrows, cucumbers, peas, etc.\nThere is a chance that we go to live down at Yantlet and we may go next week all being O.K. I don’t know whether it is for the better or worse as there are good and bad points for either side.\nThere was a picture on here tonight called \"Pride of the Yankees\" and also a good news reel. It was jolly good. Of course all the doors and windows had to be closed as it was light outside and by the time the picture ended you could have baked a cake in the hall. I was soaked in sweat.\nThe villagers here have been put down a peg over theese ensa and film shows. They always used to get in and bag the best seats before we got up there. Now they are not allowed in until the boys are all seated. Thats shook ‘em.\nWell darling I must close now partly because news and scribble is getting short and partly because its getting late and I’ve got a job or two to do before I get into bed and dream.\nGoodnight darling,\nYours for ever\nBern\n\n xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n x x\n x x\nxxxxx xxxxx\n"

Please excuse the pencil but I’ve run dry in the ink tank and am too lazy to go over to the NAAFI. I shall be going over later and will get it then.\nDon’t say anything about that suggestion of sending printed forms with the money from Bucks. I’d sooner write a letter otherwise I’d feel as though I hadn’t thanked them. I don’t mind writing a letter to them but just said it was awkward putting the right ‘tone’ on it.\nWell, I don’t think Edie is lucky having the time off because her husbands on embarkation leave. I’d sooner have no leave if embarkation was written in front of it. Our OC was supposed to have come here yesterday to inspect the plant etc. He never turned up in the morning so we had to stop down Yantlet all the afternoon. They rung about 4 o’clock to say that he wasn’t comming. Our afternoon was wasted! We are not going down Yantlet to live yet. I bet it doesn’t come off, not that I care.\nOne of the boys here told his wife when he was home last that he could get cigarettes from the naafi girl as he was getting on OK with the naffi girl. In the next letter to him when he got back she put in a crack about how he was getting on with this girl and in joke he answered that he was getting along fine.\nYou should have seen the letter she wrote back. It was three whole pages, going off the deep end about the girl. He properly got the wind up! He went on a 24 hrs today and I can see him comming back with black eyes. Its been a real joke round here for the past couple of days.\nOld ‘Dosey’ is always out for a joke, I should think his wife should be used to him by now. \nStan, another of the boys, had a telegram this afternoon to say he was a father. He has got what he wanted, a boy. He has been saving 3d bits for it and has got a ton of them (well not actualy a ton).\nI don’t know which day I shall get home yet darling, as I don’t know when I shall be on duty. I am on tonight but whether I shall be on Tuesday or Wednesday I don’t know. I’d rather it was Tuesday so that I’d be home Wed.\nI will close now dear. I hope your cold is better now and that you can at least talk. \nGoodnight darling,\nYours,\nBern\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\n"

Its a pity we didn’t have very long together dear but if I get the next one on Sunday we’ll be together all day and if the weather is nice is will be all the better.\nI am not on duty tonight as I imagined I would be. I’m on tomorrow instead so I have the time to write this letter although I can’t think of anything. This is getting a real puzzle as I’ve sat here for over 5 minutes trying to think of something, I believe I’ve told you every scrap of tripe whilst I was hope, and that wasn’t much.\nOne of the chaps is sitting here doing some knitting! Yes, I said knitting. Hes making a shawl for one of his relations’ baby that the stork hasn’t brought yet. It looks okey doke.\nI will leave this letter for a while in the hope of thinking of something.\nI’m sorry darling, I have nothing more to write so am afraid I must close.

I promised to write a long one tonight but goodness knows what about.\nWe are having some lovely weather for June ain’t we darling? It was more like January today and we had to hand out 4th blanket in this morning because its now Summer according to army rules and regulations. I spent most of the afternoon in bed, its the only warm place. I was on duty last night but nothing out of the usual happened. I was on my usual job in the D/S.\nThe NAAFI is allowing 40 cigarettes on a coupon this week instead of the usual 20. That means we’ll get 80 this week and as I exchanged my chocolate coupon for a cig card I’ll get 120 at the old price. The NAAFI must have had an extra number in. I’ve a jolly good mind to pack smoking up, for a while anyway.\nWell darling, one week-end is over so that I shall be home now on Sunday week. It doesn’t sound long does it dear. I hope the weather is better than it is at present. I will close now and write a note to mum, then get into bed as its not twenty to ten.

I suppose Warren guessed why you were late Friday morning. It was a good job you caught a train pretty quick or you’d have been later still.\nSorry you will have to work longer hours dear especially if you’ve no work to do. It will mean I shall have to wait longer to see you dear when I come home during the week.\nIf you happen to see Ken Harman at any time, remember me to him will you. He left Bucks such a long while that I’d forgotten him. Do the sales ledger people make a subscription for their chaps in the forces just as B.L. does?\nIts now 3 hours since I wrote that last word as we all had to go down Yantlet for the afternoon which I didn’t expect. There is an ensa show on tonight at 7 o’clock which I hope is good.\nI am now writing this from the D.S. on a table with a telephone on each side, some chap japping on the wireless about music in the films (goodness knows why I’ve got it on) and a watch overhead saying its twenty five past ten. This letter is quite a running commentary (spelt wrongly question mark, full stop)\nThe ensa show was quite good for the simple reason that it had a good comedian in it. There was also a good singer, a trick pianist? and an ordinary one. I’ve seen better shows but I’ve also seen alot worse.\nFor your information\n(Music while you write has just come on)\nWell dear, it is no longer a fortnight before I see you again. I’m determined to get Sunday week by hook or by crook but please don’t be too disappointed if I can’t get it by hooking and crooking. Its a lot better writing letters up here than in the barrack room with all the noise & babble. Here I feel as if I’m talking to you instead of writing. If only I were! I would have no need to put my kisses on the bottom of this letter then. I’m sorry dear that I never room you out last witsun, if only I knew then what I know now. Still, as you say dear, we shall make it up after they’ve finished playing about with theese shells and bombs etc. I can’t seem to realise what it will be like, its so good that I can’t grasp it. It wont be long now dear, so until then we must be content with 24hrs and 9 day leaves, when I think we enjoy ourselves as much as possible.\nI must close now as its getting late so good night darling.\nOnly yours dearest,\nBern\nxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxx\n xxxxx\n"

I’m sorry I didn’t write last night but there was a film on called \"Jestlight Serenade\" and ofcourse there was little time for letter writing. I did write a letter to dad though, as he wrote to me nearly a fortnight ago and last night was the first oportunity I had. Mum sends my letters to him do it wasn’t all that important.\nSorry to hear Bill Craze had a ducking. I shouldn’t fancy it myself. I expect its upset his nerves quite a bit as he always was that way inclined. I think Warren was a bit of a basket not letting Olive go. You must have upset him during the day.\nI don’t think we could have arranged to see each other if we had puzzled out brains out, for witsun. I shall be working all the morning in any case. Never mind I hope to be with you in 10 days time. I would not dream of going out the whole day when I’m home on a 24 hours. Mum looks forward to me coming home as much as any mother could and I wouldn’t disappoint her if I could possibly help it. To me my parents are the best in the world darling. Ken too would cry his eyes out and I’m sure Claude would be disappointed too.\nI have been strawberry picking tonight. I earnt 5/- anyway. We worked from half past five untill eight. We went on Wednesday night but only got 3/6 as we didn’t start so early. I havent got a stomach ache but feel a bit stiff round the back and legs. Its a back-aching job.\nI should have been on duty tonight but have changed it with Harry Meek for Sunday, then he will do my Sunday shift next week so that I can come home. I’ve got things worked out!\nWe had M.R.D. (marching rifle drill) today. The first time I’ve had it for about 7 months. No-one has had it for ages and we were all a bit rusty at first but it soon came O.K. (we hope)\nIts now 10:30 darling, and I have nothing more to write about so I’ll close. Good night dear.

People used to say \"I saw you at so-and-so last night\" and I hadn’t been near there and once I was told I was out one Sunday at 6 o’clock which was an impossible feat for me.. I don’t know what this world is coming to if there is 3 of us roaming loose!\nYes dear Kens birthday is the 25th June, its not a fortnight now. It’ll be a job finding something for him this year.\nBreakfast in bed, you’re terrible. As a matter of fact, and for your information (and delight), I don’t like breakfast in bed.\nI hope you enjoyed the holiday dear it made a break from the Black hole of BTH anyway. To us here it hasn’t been much different from an ordinary weekend except that we had yesterday afternoon off. Some of us went over to Sheerness for the Regimental sports and had quite an enjoyable afternoon as it was quite fine. About 5:30 we decided to return to catch the six o’clock boat and the three of us went in search of the other two who we lost earlier in the afternoon. Then it began to thunder and lightening. It didn’t stop to rain it just fell down and we had to take shelter in a tent. Within 10 minutes the ground was flooded and the remainder of the sports cancelled. We raced back to the jetty as soon as the rain stopped just in time to see the back of the boat gradually getting smaller in the distance. We then had to wait until eight for the next one. We had to pass the time away in the Naffi in a fort there. I got back just in time to go on shift.\nOne of the chaps from the fort, Bdr Hughs, died in hospital a week ago and his funeral is today at Barking where he comes from. He has some trouble of some sort with his kidneys. About a fortnight ago one of our boys said to him \"You’re dieing on your feet, Charlie\", with which he replied \"Yes, I am\" never thinking for a moment that it would come true.\nThe sun is shining nicely just now, although it is not very warm. It was terrible yesterday evening but luckily it stopped raining for a while while we got down to the plant. The wind was having a race with himself too.\n(22:00) I was going \"picking\" again tonight but it looked like rain after tea and also there was an ensa show on so I didn’t go. The ensa had a really hot comedian in it who brought the house down the whole time.\nI think I will make this the finish as there is little more to say. It wont be long to Sunday when we shall be together again for the whole day. Theres only one thing wrong, that that twenty four hours wont last for ever. Still I’m lucky to get even that darling and time will soon slip by to August when I shall be back again for another 9 days. With you darling and weather such as last time we shall make it as good, if not better, than the last one.\nGoodnight dearest,\nYours,\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx\n"

I was out Strawberrying again but the plants are getting very poor now and there are hardly any fruit left. I only got 4/- and worked harder than ever I have. I think that is the end of the strawberries for this year. It is for me at any rate. Its not worth the trouble now. It will be spud basking next.\nI was on duty last night but nothing happened. I got back from the strawberry field about 8:30 and visited the naffi and went straight down to the plant.\nThe weather is not looking too rosy today and I hope it will be a bit better for Sunday when I shall be home for sure, well, as sure as what you can be in the army. I shall be on duty on Saturday so will have to be up early Sunday morning to get back, washed, changed, and walk up to Stoke. There are no buses on a Sunday. I shall get up when the \"end of offical night\" comes through about five o’clock.\nI must close dear as time is getting short. Sorry I can’t write any more but if I posted this tomorrow morning you would not get it till Sunday when I shall be home and that would be silly.\n(Its beginning to rain now so I hope we don’t go down to Yantlet)\nGive my love to all at Sunnyside and tell them I shall see them on Sunday (Don’t tell me, I know you’ve already told them\nBye bye darling I’m looking forward to Sunday very much\nYours for ever\nBern\n"

I recieved your Thursdays letter, thank you darling, when I arrived back this morning safe & sound with zero no mishaps at about a quarter past eleven, had a cup of tea in \"Sandys\" the cafe and have now had dinner and changed ready for 2 o’clock when we start again.\nYou ask why you should be delighted at my not liking breakfast in bed. Well that means I shan’t mind so much getting breakfast for you in bed. Otherwise it might be the case of you getting up and getting it for me. We’re looking a bit ahead though ain’t we dear? Still, I like building castles in the air darling we’ll have to try it out next time I’m home again. Only a fortnight till then darling it isn’t long is it? The weather certainly did change yesterday dear although as you say, it went miles to quickly.\nDarling, I think you have got me all wrong. I wish I could put it in words exactly what I should like to say, its impossible. You don’t seem to realise how great my love is for you dear nor how much I feel or would give for you. If only I could prove or make you understand what you mean to me darling I would be alot happier.. I should then feel that we both understood each other in such a way that we should be as one person, knowing what each other likes and having absolute trust in the others faithfulness. Thats what I want us to be like darling so that we shall never be apart even though I may be miles away from you. My love for my parents is a different sort of love, a sort of faithfulnes and trustworthy one. It must seem strange to you.\nI know too darling what choice I would take between you and my parents dear and I’m certain it would be the same as yours. I know from past experience that you still wont believe me but one day I may be able to show you how mad I’m getting, mad with love.\n3:50 I pick up my pen again dear. Since I last wrote we have been doing a spot of bayonet practice that lasted until 3 o’clock and then spent the rest of the afternoon on the beach.\nIt wasn’t so nice, as the sun was shy of comming out. It is lovely one minute and the next it looks cloudy and as if it would rain. It certainly didn’t keep as fine as yesterday. Yesterday was nice even though the wind did get up during the afternoon. I could have stayed in Chigwell the whole day I think. I do hope that sting you got on your leg hasn’t turned bad or anything dear.\nThere is nothing to write about that I can think of so I will close now.\nGoodnight darling,\nYours for ever\nBern\n"

I am writing this at Yantlet and it is now twenty past eleven but as I have nothing to do for a while and I have a pencil and paper here I’ve started. We had a couple of big pots come and visit us today, and after all the place had been cleaned up like a new penny, he hardly looked at it. Tomorrow we have an officer coming to take us for proficiency on different stuff (bye bye tonight)\nFriday evening. We have had the above officer down today. I had a test on Telephonist and also Bren gunner but don’t know the results yet. He was the whole day down there (Yantlet) giving different tests. He wasn’t a bad chap though.\nIt has been a nice day here again today. Summer seems to have come at last.\nThank you darling for your Wednesdays letter, I’ve only just received it as its been in the office all day. No one has had time to collect it what with this officer coming. Glad to hear that your mother is having a good time on holiday. The weather is with her any way.\nI’m afraid I shall not be able to get home for a few weeks dear as the passes have been stopped. Never mind dear I’ll get one as soon as I can. \nNo dear I think there is no dout left between us two now darling. All the mist has now cleared for ever showing even a greater happyness than before.\nI must close now darling so goodnight and God bless you\nJust yours dearest,\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

You will notice now that Yantlet is no longer in my address as I have been posted to Grain Fort. (Out of one room into another) This means that I shan’t be able to get the 24 hours passes as I used to as I come under a different discipline (I can’t spell it). I am going to get my 48 hrs as soon as I can darling to make up for it. I’ll let you know if and when I get it. I am still on lights.\nI’m afraid there is little I can write about just now. Everything is about the same as usual and I’m with a decent croud of chaps. I havent the faintest idea why I’ve been changed but the army will have its own way.\nYour mother has certainly choosen the correct time for her holiday hasn’t she darling? It should be nice at this time of year, though.\nWell darling if I get my 48 hrs in a week or two we can go out somewhere and take some food with us instead of dashing about as we did last time and being an hour late in the bargain. Never mind about the 24 hrs, August will soon be here.\nI’m afraid this is letter about nothing in particular darling but please forgive me, my brain never was ment to work.\nBye bye dear, I hope you and Rene are getting on OK with the house work and that poor Tim isn’t going through it too much.\nFor ever yours,\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

Thank you very much for Mondays letter which I received yesterday. I should have written yesterday but somehow it didn’t get written. I’m sorry dear. I was on duty last night.\nI am writing this during the lunch hour as I may be going to Sheerness this evening to the Pictures. We are allowed to go to Sheerness the days we are off duty. We get the 4 o’clock boat from a pier further up the river and catch one back about 8 or 10.\nI’m glad you got back safely on Sunday dear I was thinking of you that night, wondering how you would get on. Its a pitty you had to walk it.\nI suppose your new tooth does feel a bit awkward but I expect you will soon get used to it. You’ll have to eat on the sides of your mouth for the time being. Don’t be like Doris and put it in your lap every time you sit down to eat.\nYes, it was very hot on Sunday night and I took my shirt off when I went to bed and in the morning I had about a dozen mosqueto bites on me. Gravesend is even worse than Grain for those things. A couple of chaps here in the CASLs have got one eye closed up with bites. I’ve been pretty lucky as I havent had many. The only way to get to sleep is to cover your self right over with the blankets. It makes it hot but we have to put up with it.\nI don’t hear from any of the Bucks boys now. \nThe might be at the North pole for all I know.\nI must close now darling as its nearly time for the 1:30 parade and if I go over to Sheerness tonight I shall not have time to write.\nBye bye dear I’ll write a long letter next time to make up for this short one.\nYours always,\nBern\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nGnr. B Shepherd\nCASL\nGrain Fort\nIsle of Grain\n\nMy Darling,\nThank you very much for Wednesdays & Thursdays letters and also for the nibs. As yes I have not found the holder but I think it has slipped down the bottom of my kit bag and I don’t feel like turning all the mess out tonight. As a matter of fact I can write better with a pencil but ink is so much more clearer to read especialy with the terrible pencils they make now.\nI’m glad that altering the date of my leave is OK with you, although it has put dad in a bit of a mess. Firstly, he has arranged for his holidays to be from the 8th of August, and also his landlady has let his bedroom out for that week to some people comming up on holiday. He is in a flat spin.\nI hope you are still sticking to your extra tooth all day as you were on Wednesday. I expect your gums will soon stop being sore after you’ve had it a few days.\nI’m glad to hear that Edie has had a letter from her husband. It certainly was quick work. I wonder if he has any thing to do with this latest invasion of Sicily. By the sound of things at the present everything seems to be going OK out there doesn’t it?\nOf all the Bluepencil cheek! If you ask me I think that Burnie is taking my name in vain. I never told him he couldn’t grow a moustache, not in earnest anyway. I may have done in joke but I’m afraid I don’t remember every little crack I make. Anyway, if he likes to blame it on to me I don’t mind, its him that has got to wear it, not me.\nYes, it would be ackward if it rained the day that you come down here darling but I expect we could find somewhere dry, goodness knows where. I’ll have to put my thinking cap on just incase it should rain, although I don’t think it will as we are pretty lucky with reguards to the weather. If it is raining before you start out and looks like keeping on it would be best not to come as the weather is pretty general around here.\nI am on duty tonight as I was off yesterday and went to Sheerness to the pictures. I hadn’t been to the cinema from quite a while untill this week when I went twice. I’m breaking all records and my pocket. On Thursday, when I went over, I saw \"Synconation\" (I believe thats the name) and yesterday \"Ransom Harvest\", both very good, I expect you have seen them. Last night I made a row in the band.\nI will close now and go round to the naffi for a cup of tea before I go on duty. We parade at 9:30 for it.\nGive my love to all at 59, I’ll get all the dope and let you know about comming down next time I write. Its a pity it is an indirect journey to Sheerness as I can very often get ½ day to there on a Sunday.\nGoodnight darling, will be seeing you soon.\nYours for ever & ever\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nGnr. B Shepherd\nCASL\nGrain Fort\nIsle of Grain\n\nDarling Kath,\nHere I am again dear with a bit of bright news for you. We are now going to get 24 hr passes once a week and they will be from 2 o’clock until 2 which is certainly a lot better than 8:30. I believe they are starting next week but don’t know for sure. Also when off duty at night we shall be off from 2 o’clock in the afternoon instead of 4. The reason for these changes is that our O.C. has gone away and another has taken his place who isn’t quite such a ----------. He seems to be quite a nice chap.\nWe are once again short of men and are doing 2 nights out of 3 and I am on tonight again. The reason for the shortage is that there are 2 men on leave, one on 48 hours, 1 hospital, 1 on leave as he has just had an addition to the family, and ofcourse the 3 who do not do night duties. Another one, whom I forgot, is at Sheerness for a week training for boxing.\nI’ve got a job on now of sewing on \"tigers\" (you saw those that Jim was wearing) and also new flashes as the ones I have on at present are not correct regimental size. I shall do them tomorrow night, I think. Tonight I have been busy with the blancs. The colour of our blancs has been altered so everything has to be blancoed again. My equipment neaded it anyway as I hadn’t done it for ages. We have a full inspection on Saturday so it must be done.\nNot for the times of the trains dear. I have a time table in front of me so here goes. For Sunday:- from Gravesend. 7:00AM gets in 7:32.- 9:13 get in 9:45 - 11:12 gets in 11:44 - 2:12 gets in at 2:44. The 11-12 will suit you the best dear if you intend to come down, although actualy it is a bit early. If you caught the 2:12 I should be able to be at the station to meat you. The trains back at night are 5 o’clock gets to Gravesend at 5:34 (to early) and the next and last one at 8:24 which gets in at 8:59. That would mean that you would have to catch that 10 o’clock train back and walk back from Barking. Thats the worst of Sunday, there is very little transport and I’m afraid we couldn’t have it any other day as you are at work, I shouldn’t come this week end darling as I shan’t be off untill late, whereas the Sunday after I should be able to get off early. When you come up dear make sure you get off at Middle Stoke instead of Stoke Juctn. Holt which is the next station. Middle Stoke is where Stoke village is. I must close now dear as its time for duty. Goodnight darling, Bern.\nP.S. I’ve just found out that its not definate that we get theese 24 hr passes, still lets hope for the best. Bye bye dear\nYours for always, Bern\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nGnr. B Shepherd\nCASL\nGrain Fort\nIsle of Grain\n\nDarling,\nThank you very much for Fridays letter dear which was waiting for me when I got back this morning. I’m glad to say that I got back safely this morning without mishap, although I’m not going to catch a late train like that again as I had to sleep in Gravesend station waiting room. That train from Barking overtook that electric one before it reached Dagenham and was at Upminster about 10 minutes before the Tilbury train went. I would have caught it just the same if I had got on that district train as that was also in a couple of minutes before mine went. At Tilbury I had to wait a quarter of an hour for a ferry, and when I reached the YMCA they were full. I then went straight down to the station (it was about 11:30 then) and got some sleep on the seat in there. I’m afraid the \"bed\" was a bit hard and the room itself was like an ice box but I didn’t sleep too bad. The porter woke me a 5 when he removed the blackouts and I caught the 0700 which got me into the fort dead on 0830 hrs. You can stop worrying now that you know I’m safe.\nWe can soon find time to visit Glady the next time I’m on leave (5 weeks dear). If we make up our minds to visit them before I have my leave we shall be able to go.\nThat is actually all there is to answer in your letter dear as mostly everything was cleared up whilst I was home.\nThe weather is not very good today and looks as though it will rain any minute. I have been asleep for a while this afternoon as that was the cosiest place.\nWell, I suppose I had better close and then write and tell the family I’ve been home. I hope the weather is a bit better than this where they are.\nThank you for the nice time yesterday dear the weather always seems to be on our side doesn’t it?\nGive my love to mum, Rene, and Tim. Bye bye dearest.\nYours for ever\nBern\n"

Still, it was worth it for the little time we had together.\nIf everything turns out as it should do I shall see you at Sheerness station about 2 o’clock or a little before dear and we can have a few more hours together.\nSo I shall be there at the station round about 2.\nWhat weather! It has been raining all day today here and I expect it is the same at Ilford. I feel sorry for mum and the boys if it is the same at Burnham on Sea. They were looking forward to the holiday very much and if they have to stop in some one elses house all day it wont be very nice.\nNothing much has happened here this week and everything is much the same as before.\nBy the sound of your letter darling the wedding party wasn’t such a success as you would have liked it to be. Wasn’t there enough young blood there, then? I can imagine what it was like if they were all old grannies.\nEddie is pretty unlucky with his leave, isn’t he? Its a big shame realy to keep mucking him about like that, I can guess what you would be saying if it was me.\nThose intelligence chaps who shout about what they know generally don’t know a thing. Hung up in one room of the fort is a saying\n\"Those who know don’t talk\nThose who talk don’t know.\nQuite good, eh?\nI can’t think of anything else to write so it wasn’t really any good starting this page.

Thank you for comming. I hope you enjoyed yourself as much as what I did, it was grand. The weather was wonderful to turn out so lovely for us also. It has been nice again today here, I hope it stays like it untill after I have had my leave.\nIt is 3 o’clock now as I am on duty from 3 till half past four and feel a bit rough just getting up.

I shall be asleep again in a minute if I’m not careful.\nThe mosquetioes were arround again last night. Thats the worst of nice weather, it brings them out again. I got under the blankets at first but it was miles too hot so I chanced it the correct way. They gave me a few bites to get on with.\nI can’t think of any more to write about dear whether its because I am only half awake or not I don’t know.\nThis dead and alive hole Grain Grain aught to be awakened up abit so that I could find something to write about. Oh! I forgot. You like me being poked away on a desert Island don’t you? Never mind I’m enjoying myself down here OK as long as the weather doesn’t turn too bad.\nI must close now dear as I have nothing to write about so cheerio dear give my love to everyone at home, I’ll write a longer letter next time.\nBye bye\nYours,\nBern\n"

I think you should ask Warren realy darling although you know you wont get the whole week off. I shouldn’t feel very comfortable if you just took it with no excuse or anything. You’re just asking for trouble.\nHow are the smokes going? I’ve got a mind to take that bet on with you even now as you wont keep it up long.\nI hope Tim got back safely yesterday. It was certainly a surprise to see him as I had forgotten that he might pop down: I was comming from the wash house at dinner time when your note was given to me and I wondered what was up when I saw no stamp on it. When the chap informed me that he was outside I guessed who it was. I expect Tim told you we went on the beach. There is a rumour that the beach will be out of bounds in the near future but nothing official has come about yet. Its a pity as we spend most of out time off down there when the weather is so nice, theres nothing else to do and we have quite a bit of enjoyment down there. It’ll be a real prison soon.\nCould you send me down a drop of writing paper, please dear as we can only get those NAAFI issue and they are few and far between.\nI cannot think of anything else to write at the moment dear. \nWe are going out for a bike ride this afternoon, we have borrowed a couple of bikes as we’ll have a ride round for a while. We can’t get that bike in to commition which we have as we can’t get a front wheel for it. It will be a pity if we can’t get it going as it would come in very handy.\nI hope you enjoy the holiday this week end dear and I wish I could have come down but I couldn’t. I could have had a 24 hrs today or yesterday but there was no travelling allowed so it wasn’t much good. I’ll get one in a week or two though, I hope.\nGive my love to all at home, and bye bye for a while. I’ll write again very soon.\nYours, Bern\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

It was hot and the hall was packed to full and, ofcourse, all the windows were closed owing to the blackout. I had to change all my cloethes as they were wringing wet when I got back.

As I placed the paper, ink, etc, on the table to commence writing he exclaimed that I always seemed to be writing letters!!! Look dear I write to you as often as I can. Ofcourse, I know that if I stopped in every night and also rushed up from dinner and did a bit of scribbling every few minutes that I could find to spare I should be writing a book to you every week but I’m not built that way. I believe in getting away from this prison as much as possible and enjoying myself. This is how it works out. I’m on every other night and there is very little time to write the nights I’m on duty. Most nights that I’m off I go out just to make a change as the inside of this place looks even worse than the outside and Tim will tell you what thats like. Tim saw me on Saturday and I was in the best of health then.\nYes dear it wont be long now before I am home again. The weather has turned very funny the last couple of days and doesn’t seem much like August. The weather clerk will put it right for the 19th though. He always does. I think I must be in his good books or else you are. Have you made your mind up as to how you are getting the time off?\nDid Ella go to Cornwall for the whole week? I suppose she had a case with her which she could have sat on and in any ‘case’ I expect she found a nice young gentleman to pass the time with. From the way you speak she enjoyed herself O.K.\nI don’t think there is much news from the Isle of Pain today. They have banned us from going onto the beach now, that was only a rumour when Tim came down. We shall feel it when (and if) the weather turns out nice again.\nI had better pack up now dear and scribble a letter to mum as I havent written to her for well over a week and then get to bed as I havent had much sleep lately. Monday there was a dance at the AA camp which lasted to 1 o’clock and I didn’t get to sleep untill 2. Tuesday I was on duty and had a run rather late and only got about 4 hours sleep in all and Wednesday I didn’t play in the band as I had a head ache so I did get to sleep pretty early although it was turned 11 o’clock as our room is too noisy to get to sleep early. Last night I was on duty again and got to kip at 1:30.\nGoodnight darling give my love to all at 59. Will be seeing you on the 19th. I couldn’t get a 24 hrs this weekend as other chaps hadn’t had one so recent as I.\nBye bye dear,\nYours,\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxx\n"

Shepherd\nCASL\nGrain Fort\nIsle of Grain\nKent\n\nDearest Kath,\nThank you for Thursdays letter dear.\nThat telegram from you had no mention of a reply and as I had already sent a letter which you should have received before you would have recieved a telegram from me, I didn’t send one. As I know you, I’m not very frightened by your threat of ticking me off. Still, if you do I’m prepared, so beware, I have it all worked out.\nSo you had to register on Saturday, did you dear? Maybe the war will be over before you go, especially if Bucks gives you an extension of about 6 months. What have you put down for anyway.\nOfcourse, I don’t mind you writing to that chap dear you know very well I don’t.\nIt is Monday now as I had not time to finish it last night as I had to go and man the D.S. Actually, I wasn’t on duty but there was a run and I had to go up on the switches as it was a special turnout. Tonight will make it the 5th night I’ve been on in succession. Thursday I was on, Friday they had one of theese specials’, Saturday I was on again, last nightb I was on untill 12:30 as I just told you and I am on officaly again tonight. I hope to be off tomorrow night!\nHas Tim had any success in getting a wheel or at least a hub for me dear? If not I’ll ask Claude to have a scout round for me, hes pretty good at raking things out of theese out-of-the-way shops. We have managed to get (by fair means or fowl) an old bike which will be in service in a couple of days as it only neaded taking down and cleaning.\nThe weather has been nice today hasn’t it darling? Its a pity we are banned from the beach or else we would be down there now. Maybe its not a pity, though, as I shouldn’t be writing this letter if I was.\nI saw \"Casablanca\" again the other day, when it was at the fort, a marvelous picture, I think. Last week I saw \"Money for Jam\" at Sheerness which I didn’t think very much of. There was a cowboy film with it (I can’t think of the name) which wasn’t too bad.\nI can’t think of any thing else for the present dear so I will close on this sheet. I’m just trying to make a pen write for one of the boys so excuse the writing. Give my love to all at home and so cheerio untill I see you when I come home. Yours, Bern\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

I know jolly well you would say something if I didn’t write for 6 weeks, anyway I’m sorry I didn’t write, now lets forget it all before it turns into a row. Well, at least untill I see you again dear as I know you wont forget it then. It wont be long now. Only another week. I hope we enjoy ourselves as much as we did last time darling.\nI’m sorry I disapointed you by not comming down at the weekend, and I don’t suppose I shall be up untill the 19th but you can never tell, I might be able to slip up. No, I shall not be able to come up the night before dear as its completely out of the question but I’ll be up as soon as possible you can bet. I hope you have planned alot of things as you say in your letter and we will indevour to carry them out this time.\nI hope you didn’t eat all those blackberries and make yourself sick.\nYou’ve brought up that nasty crack about \"The awful place grain\" once more but I’ll take no notice of it. Yes, the dances are generaly packed out.\nYes, dad altered his holiday alright as I expect you know if you went round on Tuesday. Thank you dear if you did.\nI think that is all for the letters. I have had a change in my address again dear as I am no longer on the lights but on the guns now. I was changed over yesterday afternoon. Enough to make you sick, ain’t it? Just got settled down and then another change. Still, I don’t mind, I can get home occationaly. What makes me most wild is that I had a lovely job on the CASLs, incharge of the serchlight stores and I’ve lost it now. Its a pity.\nI must close now to go on duty, I am still in the B.O.P. but the gun section instead of the lights.\nGive my love to all at 59 and it wont be long now.\nT.T.F.N.\nYours,\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxx\n"

Still, don’t lets argue whos falt it was, lets forgive and forget.\nNow I’ll start to answer the letter darling; its a nice long one, goodness knows how you managed it as mine usualy run dry after the first page. Thats the worst of having very little grey matter.\nI don’t suppose you would fancy factory work, would you dear? Maybe it would be in the office of a factory, or don’t they work that way?\nNo dear I can’t see you going to work next week either but whats to be done if you are unable to get a certificate? We shall soon see on Friday.\nSo Bought Ledger as loosing two valuable people, are they? Its funny they should be both about the same time, old Warren will have a fit if he doesn’t know yet.\nFancy Birmingham office getting burnt out like that. When I first read it I immediatly thought of bombing untill I read the next sentence.\nNo, I havent heard from any \"Bucks boys\", I know at least Frank is not what you would call a keep writer.\nI went into that cafe oposite Gravesend station on Saturday an a chap came up and asked me how Yantlet was. I didn’t know him from Adam. He is a driver and had driven different people down there and times and remembered me. He must have a mervelious memory as he remembed picking me up at Stoke when I first came down here. He even remembered what sort of day it was! I can’t imagine how he could remember things like that when hes picking people up all day. He is at Sheerness and was waiting for the same train as me to visit some pals a couple of stations from Gravesend.\nI have a bit of a shock for you darling. It has just come through that all leave is going to be stopped but whether I shall get mine before it is stopped or not I don’t know. Don’t be supprised then if you receive a telegram saying that I can’t get up for a week or two. I’m sorry dear but I’ll do my best, you know I will.\nI am writing this in the guard room as I am on guard today. Its quite a jammy time on guard here and I don’t mind it in the least. Well, not while weather like this lasts. It will be glorious if it is like today when I’m on leave. I bed Rene and Eddie are making the best of it.\nGive my love to them and mum & Tim and I hope to see you all in 4 days time.\nBye bye darling\nYours for ever,\nBern\nP.S.

I must apologize for not sending a telegram but I have not had time to get to the post office when it was open. I didn’t know definately untill yesterday that the leave was stopped. I’ve said a few things about this battery!\nI have been on duty today untill 7 o’clock tonight. There was an ensa show on tonight at 7:30 which I went and saw. Although there were only two artists in it it as very good and its suprising how a party of 2 people (man & woman) can make a show so good.

My address has been altered once again as you will notice at the top (I havent put it in yet, as I don’t know the correct address but still). Its not a perniment change, I am only here for a fortnight on an air recognition course, then I go back to grain to tell them which plane is which. I came here yesterday (Sunday) after dinner and started the course this morning. This course is one of the best things I’ve been on so far. No parades or anything, just sitting, listening, and drawing planes all day from 9 untill 4:30. I am expecting a 24 hours pass this week end so be ready if I should come up next Saturday night or Sunday. I shall get my leave after the course is finished so will see you about the 6 of Sept or thereabouts. This is only a short note darling as I must write to mum and tell her and its 5 to 10 now (I bet you don’t believe me). Goodnight my dearest, \nXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Yours, Bern\n"

I got it yesterday as there was a delay owing to me moving.\nI’m glad you popped round home and saw dad dear. He said, in the letter I received today, that he was suprised to see you. I expect he told you that himself.\nIt is a bit doutful as to whether I shall get the pass that I spoke for the week end but there is still a chance. If I do manage to get it it will be from 12:00 Saturday untill Sunday night which will be alot better than what we have been used to. Anyway, if I don’t turn up Saturday afternoon you will know I am not comming.\nI’m sorry you came to meet me on Thursday darling when I didn’t come. It must have been terrible when I didn’t turn up. I’m sorry I didn’t send you a telegram but I was unable to get out so Wallie posted it for me. I couldn’t realy get him to do them both so I sent it home as Claude could more easily pop round with it.\nThis isn’t a very convenient place to write letters as there is no table or anything and also outside the windows is a veranda with a roof over the top which makes it rather dark in the evening. Still, its a change to be living in a town away from that dump back away over those waters. It takes 5 minutes to the cinema instead of ¾ of an hour. What a difference.\nThe Recognition is still going on OK. We have 28 aircraft to learn in this fortnight and I am quite enjoying it. I always did like drawing (even though I’m no good at it) and this is all drawing for this week anyway.\nI hear that Rene called Claude ‘Bern in minature’. I expect its the horn rimmed glasses that did the trick.\nI don’t know why but I havent been able to concentrate on letter writing somehow tonight. Maybe its because I’ve been drawing all day.\nI can think of no more so I will now write to Bucks and that them for the money. I havent had time to answer before.\nI must close now dear give my love to all at No. 59.\nGoodnight my love\nYours,\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

When I got to Sittingbourne I met one of the boys, he said he saw me pass his carriage at Victoria but didn’t call out as you was with me. I didn’t get in any earlier by catching that 8:15 as the Sheerness train; although it came in soon after I got there, it waited for the other one which came in about 20 minutes later. Never mind, I did get a seat at Sittingbourne which i would not have done if I had caught the later one. That train according to the time table should have got to Sheerness at 10:30 but didn’t get there untill 3 minutes to eleven. I’ve now been told that line is always late. It was late coming down on Saturday and kept stopping for a breather every now and then. It was ¾ of an hour late on Saturday.\nI am writing this in the NAAFI as it is a bit more comfortable that writing on the bed. Its a bit quieter in this NAAFI than Grain one and there is more room as its about 4 times as big. The other 3 boys have gone out, my pal to a dance at \"The Wheatsheaf\", the co-op dance hall which they say is one of the best floors anywhere round here, anothers at the pictures and the other as per usual is sampling the beer. He generaly rolls in around 2 o’clock so where he goes I don’t know (I might have a good idea, though).\nA chap came over while my mate was sitting with me a few minutes ago and asked if we were brothers as we looked very much alike. I thought it was a very good compliment to me. I can’t see it myself as he is rather on the broad thick side.\nThank you so much for the lovely weekend dear. I believe I’ve heard that as a tune somewhere before, havent I? Only a week or so and I shall be home again and whether the weather is wet or fine I know I shall enjoy myself as long as you are with me dearest. Still, the weather always is fine when we are together isn’t it dear.\nI never recieved your letter today and appearently no one knows anything about it. I suppose you did put the Sheerness address on it didn’t you dear? Maybe I’ll get it tomorrow when someone suddenly discovers it.\nThe Air Rec is still going strong today and everyone came back OK last night to continue plane spotting. I now know the difference between a Spitfire and a Lancaster, so I’m getting pretty good! Tomorrow they are going to show us the flying flee and the mosqueto.\nWell darling I’m afraid I must close now and according to the cracks yesterday I shall write again just before I come home. Well, we shall see.\nGoodnight dearest, I’ll see you soon\nYours for ever\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Bern\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

They wouldn’t let me swim in it as they say I’m to high class and might show the others up. !?\nI hope you enjoy the show at the palladium on Saturday dearest. I only wish I was there with you but that can’t be helped, its no use wishing.\nI like the crack about keeping her waiting whoever \"her\" is.\nYes, I remember Joan McArthy. Give her my love when you write will you (not censored). Colin wants to know all the answers doesn’t he? I bet he will know them all when he gets a bit older.\nWe have been to see those mirrors I was talking of when I was home last week. It looks very realistic with all coloured lights making clouds and different coloured sky. It passed this afternoon away very well.\nYesterday I saw a couple of terrible films, one was [blank] and the other \"Secret Agent\" or something. It was the same old tripe about Nazi agents anyway. I recond I could make films just as bad myself. I hope to see two decent films tomorrow evening \"Moon & Sixpence\" and another which supposed to be very good too.\nWell deare, ¾ of this course is gone and when its finished I hope to get my leave and we shall then be together for a whole 9 days.\nWell darling I’m afraid I have run out of news at the moment. I think my pencil has run dry or something.\nGive my love to Mum, Rene, & Tim dear\nGoodnight darling\nYours for ever & ever\nBern\n"

Actualy, we should go Saturday but we may as well have Sat. afternoon over here as we may be shoved on duty and that would be too bad.\nYou need not worry dear I have passed the course OK. I got a 100%. I got every plane right. There were 5 of us who got a 100: My pal and I both for a hundred and it was realy quite easy. There were 3 who did not pass. I nearly got one of them wrong, I put down Typhoon for a thunderbolt at first and while he was showing us another I realised my mistake. There is no likeness at all in a Typhoon and a Thunderbolt but I got the names mixed up at first. We shall just be clearing up tomorrow morning.\nI went and saw \"The Moon and Sixpence\" last night and it was jolly good. It is a very unusual picture. I saw \"Brookland Orchid\" with it.\nThe weather has been very dull today and this morning when we went out on the bank it was quite chilly. We went out there to get some fresh air and discuss planes at the same time. It was a bit nippy but its better than sitting in that room all day.\nWell darling I will close now, sorry my letters are not what they should be but I can’t write that way somehow.\nGoodnight darling\nYours for ever dear\nBern\n"

I could have written Sunday night but as I didn’t know whether I was comming on leave or not I left it untill Monday. On Monday I was on duty and had an excercise which lasted untill well past midnight so it was left untill last night when I was shoved on guard and what with cooking the supper and sentry from 9:30 till 11:30 it had to be left untill this morning.\nI’m very sorry I disappointed you by not coming home this week but all leave has been cancelled once again as the whole battery is going to Llandudno for a week on Gunnery. We are going next week and will be back Friday night so am hoping to get it Saturday which would give me two weekends. I had a bit of a row in the office Monday morning but it would not alter their minds. Never mind darling we shall enjoy it all the more when it does come. My hopes rose on Monday afternoon when I was told the OC wanted to see me but it was only to congratulate me on the Aircraft Rec coarse. I should have had 24 hr pass today but as I was on guard I could not have it. Everything seems against me this time doesn’t it dear?\nI was also on dental yesterday afternoon over Sheerness but I didn’t have to have any out. He just scraped them. It made a bit of a rush when I got back as I had to have tea and get polished up to go on guard. Had I not been on guard I would have stayed over Sheerness and gone to the pictures as I should have been off duty last night.\nThank you very much for your letters darling. I recieved one Monday and the other today. I hope you have got rid of that cold or at least by the time I come home. I’m glad you enjoyed the show on Saturday darling. I shouldn’t think a restaurant could stay select with you croud in it.\nWell dear if you get this letter in time, I should go and see your Aunt as it will make a good change for you and I shall definately not be home untill at least Saturday week. That is the 18th, I believe. Don’t write any more letters here next week as I shall be gone on Sunday.\nThe weather hasn’t been too grand theese last few days here as its dull and miserable. Coming back from Sheerness last night it was pretty rough. It may turn for the better by a fortnight time.\nWell darling I must close now as I must write to mum and let her know of the cancelling of my leave.\nBye bye darling you’ll never believe how much I miss you when I can’t get home.\nAll my love dearest\nYours, Bern xxxxxxxx\nP.S. That picture which I left blank was \"The Magnificent Dope\". The film was dopey but it certainly wasn’t magnificent.

I’ll put it at the bottom of the letter. We are to be in houses down there, empty ones that have been taken over by the army. I shall have a look over Llandudno and see what its like so don’t be surprised if I don’t write too often. Its only for 6 days, from Sunday till Friday. After that darling I shall be home on leave (I hope)\nI had a rotten job this morning. I was witness against one of the boys who was on a charge this morning. While I was on guard on Wednesday I was writing a letter in the guard room and the other chap was on sentry duty when an officer came in and asked where the sentry was. I went outside and discovered him missing. He was then discovered coming away from the football field where there was a match going on. Ofcourse the officer immediately put him on a charge of being absent from his post. I ofcourse had to be witness.\nI have a new job for a week writing letters for a chap who can’t write. He only writes once a week thank goodness. I didn’t know he couldn’t write but his mate went on leave the other day and he asked me if I would write for him. I was very suprised as he is quite an intellegent chap. He keeps quiet and no one knows but his mate and I.\nThat chap who I told you about who made the aircraft carrier has made a rocking horse. Its marvellious job and you wouldn’t tell it from a shop one. It would get 4 or 5 quid in a shop easy. It has only taken him a fortnight to make.\nI am now up in the B.O.D. as I am on duty. The wireless is shouting out and I don’t seem to be able to think properly (I know what your thinking, I never can think).\nWell dear I hope you have thought up all the places for us to go the week after next. It wont be long now and it will soon slip by. I hope the weather changes a but as it isn’t too good at present. You can tell that winter is coming on, can’t you?

Thank you for the letters dear I’ll answer them when I get sorted out as we have just arrived back at grain.\nI’m sorry I didn’t come on leave today but we never arrived back untill 10 montues to 11 this morning. We travelled all night.\nWe started from here last Sunday at 7 o’clock and arrived at Llandudno at about ten o’clock and I got pretty well browned off by the time I got there.\nLlandudno is a very nice place but unfortunately it rained almost the whole time we were there. Anyway, it didn’t stop us from going out as the trams and buses stopped almost opposite out door. You would hardly know there was a war on there as it is just like a pre war holiday town, and we made the most of it. The things at Llandudno are very dear, though, and wouldn’t be much of a place to spend a cheap holiday at. There are crouds of holiday makers there and we were treated very well. All cinemas are ½ price for forces and some cafes charge reduced rates for us. We went into a public house on Wednesday night and could have had a barrel full of beer for nothing if we liked. They have a fun fair in the old town too which ofcourse we sampled and we had a real good climb up the hills, rocks, or mountains (which ever you like to call them) I bought some views of the place which I’ll bring up when I come. We had our snapshot taken while walking along the high street, they are not too bad. On the whole I quite enjoyed myself, although the rain spoilt everything. They get a lot of rain there.\nWe caught the train back last night at 7:30 last night and arrived in the fort at 10:50, so we were travelling 16 hours as we left the billets at 7:00.\nWe went to Llandudno for a practice shoot which only took one night, although it mucked up two as we got down there (to the guns) and prepared for it but the visibility wasn’t good enough and we waited untill almost eleven for it to clear but it didn’t. That was on Monday night.\nWe had the shoot of Tuesday night as it was lovely and clear although it kept drisseling with rain every now and then. After that they could have given us a bit of time off as there was nothing else for us to do but all we got off was Wednesday afternoon when we went to the pictures.\nI am getting my leave darling on Monday and I hope you recieve this before then. I thought it was beening stopped again as no one is allowed out of barracks owing to an exercise which is taking place here but 7 or 9 days leave are not stopped thank-goodness. There would have been another row if they had.\nAs soon as I have written to mum I am getting straight into bed as I am almost falling asleep writing this. I think I got about ½ an hours sleep last night as we didn’t have enough room to sit down.\nI must close now dear I hope you wasn’t too disappointed at my non arrival darling remember I never said I was definatly coming on Sat.\nBye bye dearest\nAll my love\nYours for ever\nBern\n"

They seem to be troubling you quite a bit lately. We get plenty of gun fire arround here but no one takes any notice of it as they never take any trouble to drop bombs here.\nYes, it did make a change to get over to Sheerness last sunday. Its a relief to get away from grain now and again.\nI now know when I \"went back off leave\" Ok, thanks dear. I like the way you write \"Don’t lets tell any more lies about your leave\" as though it was I who surgested it. If you do it again I’ll wring your neck and give the game away at the same time. So Beware!\nIf Rene was my sister I’d say something to her a bit sharpish. Still, actualy its Eddies fault so its nothing to do with you.\nNo, I wasn’t on duty on Tuesday night dear but I caught the rain just the same as I went out. Luckily I took my ground sheet with me so I didn’t get too wet. It was pouring with rain. The wind was howling and the night was pitch black. Just right for a nice country walk, with puddles everywhere.\nI am writing this whilst on guard and as I havent a great deal if time to spare and I’ve no blotting paper. I’m only writing on one side.\nI’m sorry dear but I’m not coming on my 24 hours leave on Saturday instead of Sunday. I must have made a mistake when I had a look at the book the other day but last night I asked to make sure and he said its Saturday. It can’t be helped.\nI expect we shall be going out tonight again as it is payday today. The weather seems a bit brighter now but this morning it hardly left off raining once. Winter is realy here now. Christmas wont be long and then my leave.\nI will close now darling as I shall soon be on sentry duty (for the last time today) so bye bye\nYours\nBern\nPS Be round my place tomorrow at 3 oclock if poss\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nGnr. Shepherd\n287 Battery\nGrain Fort\nIsle of Grain\n\nMy darling,\nI arrived safely back last night dear and was just in time for a drink at the Legion before they closed at 10:30. I met one of the other bots at Gravesend who was coming back the same as I. He came with us when we went up on Monday but when he got to Stoke he remembered he had left his case behind so he had to walk all the way back to the fort and didn’t catch a train before about ¼ to ten. I was glad I met him as its a dreary walk back on your own and last night was as black as ink (black ink).\nThe boys had got my blankets out of stores thank goodnes so I had a bed to sleep in. Thats the worst of getting back late you can’t get the kit out of stores untill morning. Some make a point of getting an early train to enable them to get it out but I hanged if I would. If I had the least excuse I shouldn’t have caught the one I did. I felt awful. I kept trying to look happy in the train as it was pretty crouded and people would keep looking at me so I shut my eyes imitated sleeping. I don’t feel quite so fed up this evening - I’m just beginnig to settle down again.\nThis place gives me the creeps at the best of times but its made me feel sick today.\nNothing fresh has happened here since I’ve been away which is quite a change for this place. They usually manage to alter something - generally for the worse.\nOne of the other bots is going on leave tomorrow. I wish I was going instead of just coming back. Oh for this war to be over!\nStill, we had quite a nice time even though you had to go to work. The worst of having a lovely leave is that it goes much too quickly, doesn’t it darling?\nWouldn’t it be grand if the war ended tomorrow dear and I could come home to you for good. Never mind its worth waiting for, I think. So anyway darling.\nI must close now dear and drop a line to mum. It wont be many weeks time before I see you again for a few hours.\nGoodnight darling every scrap of my love is for you. \nYours, as fed up as ever, Bern\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

We had a bit of a rush to catch the train this morning, as I went up to the station about 10 o’clock and discovered that our train went at 10:30. I had to dash back, change my shoes and collect John from the barbers as he was having a hair cut. Anyway, I got to the station in good time as there were 10 minutes to spare.\nWe were at Gravesend before 11:30 and the Stoke train doesn’t go before one o’clock so we had some time to spare. It gave us time to get some dinner.\nI meant to have seen Burnie before I came away but ofcourse it was impossible with the train going so early. The next Tilbury untill 9 minutes to one. I expect I shall see Burnie sometime though.\nDidn’t the time realy fly yesterday. It went so quickly I could wonder whether it was a dream. I’m glad I surprised you although, whilst comming I kept wondering whether you would be in. As soon as I heard footsteps comming to the door I knew you were in. Sounds daft doesn’t it (I love crossing things out)\nI have come more or less to a dead end now without a single thing to say and I’ve sat here for about ¼ of an hour and I can’t think of a thing.\nI’ve got my watch going OK or rather Lew has. Its been going [letter damaged].\nWell darling I’m afraid that is all for now as there is nout to write about.\nGoodnight darling all my love\nYours for ever\nBern\n"

Thank you for your letters and now maybe I can answer them. I am very sorry I put my foot in it by writing to Bucks on Friday. As soon as I received your letter saying that you had told them I was on leave I knew there would be a muck up with that letter. I suppose you have had to do a bit of explaining by this time, I guessed something would happen like this when you spoke of Lee asking when I was coming on leave. I’ll see it doesn’t happen again.\nFancy asking me if I mind you saying Frank looks nice in his uniform! I ask you! Anyway, I’m glad he passed O.K. He’ll be off somewhere now, I suppose. I bet hes enjoying himself a bit better than at Bucks. Frank as a clerk seemed like a round peg in a square hole to me.\nI expect Eddie will be home quite a bit now if he hasn’t so far to come. I can quite understand how Rene must feel if I get home every two or 3 weeks and her husband could only get home every 3 months.\nI am writing this whilst on guard. We don’t seem to get as much time here to write as one would expect when on guard as we’re on every other hour and if there are one or two things to do in the mean time there is precious little time left.\nThis week is our off duty week and we should be off every night at 4 o’clock except for guard and bofor look out. Well, we started on Monday, I was on bofor all day untill 8 o’clokk. Tuesday on bofor till 5. Wednesday night on guard till 5 - I hope to get off tonight! There was a film here on Tuesday called ‘George Washington slept here’ which was very good, and tonight we have an Ensa show which should be very good as it is a class B show. This week is the first time we have had a show or film for about 2 months.\nIt is my turn for look out in 5 minutes time (12:30) so will stop for a while.\nI quite expected to get this letter finished in time for the afternoon post but unfortunatly that has been impossible. It is now too late. Getting paid this afternoon mucked the contract up.\nNothing of any importance has happened during the last few days so I can’t write about it. The weather is, I suppose, about the same as at Ilford. Its very full today and has been trying to rain this afternoon.\nI wont be getting any 24 hrs next week but I think I’m getting my next one on the 24th which is 10 days time and I believe is on Sunday. If this is right I’ll let you know and then you can be round my home about 3 o’clock when I expect to get there. I don’t know whether I would be better to go straight through to London or go by bus from Tilbury. Sunday is an awkward day. Still, we get a few more hours together don’t we darling? I shall see you about 3 o’clock instead of 6.\nI must say bye bye now darling and write a letter to mum. I do hope you went round and saw her as you intended when you wrote this letter.\nBye bye dearest, I’m looking forward to Sunday week and even more to January 3rd when I shall have you for 9 days.\nYours\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

A good afternoon off this is! The sun is shining glorious and it is realy quite a nice afternoon and it is pretty clear which is a change from the mist we have been having this last week. On Sunday last it was so thick that the boat could not come across from Sheerness and about half a dozen of the chaps got stranded over there untill the following day, when the mist cleared.\nI’m afraid they didn’t let me write for long as I was collared for a job just as I finished the last sentence and I have only just come off which is now half past four and I started this letter at 2 o’clock. I’ve said a few things about this new system. As soon as my relief turns up I shall go down to tea.\nNow that I am up at the barrack room I can try and answer your letter. Thank you for that dear. I hope you got to the pictures Wednesday darling I do wish I had been with you. I will certainly appreciate all those little things after this war darling. It will be grand that I can hardly realise that it will come true.\nI don’t know what Bucks are coming to when their women staff get drunk during their lunch hour. I shouldn’t think that Bucks thinks much of her either.\nWhen I come back off leave isn’t clear, is it cancelled or is it still floating about between Llandudno, Grain, and Ilford? Its a bit backward.\nOne doesn’t know where one is! I’d better know in case I come up one day and Mr Lee should ask. If I don’t know I had better ask Mr Lee as he knows more about it than I do! I left the back of sect. 1 empty because it makes the letter look bigger, not that I just forgot and started a fresh sheet. I didn’t go back to it afterwards as it would be very confusing for you.\nI must close now.\nGoodnight dear all my love and God bless you\nYours for ever\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

I’m glad you arrived home safely and didn’t have to wait long. It was certainly better for you to come up with me & thank you for doing so. Bye the way, I remembered that five shillings when the train run out of the station. What a memory. I shall remember it though.\nNo dear the army doesn’t get any fires. Its strange, though, you never seem to notice it as you’ve never been used to it. Its just a matter of course. We muck arround in overalls all day in the open air so its little wonder that we get used to the cold.\nYou needn’t feel guilty of having a big fire as I’m not worried without one. If I havent got anything to do I generaly go to bed.\nMrs Fountains’ husband is lucky at the present but I shouldn’t fancy his job. I should sooner be here as I am.\nI expect the fog has been thicker at your place than here as it usualy is worse in London. It has been pretty thick here. The sheerness boat has not been able to run and one of the bombardiers is still stuck over there. Hes been there since yesterday morning.\nI hope your mother had a nice time. I presume that she stayed at the uncles that you spoke of who was called away on home guard. You don’t seem to know many of your relations, do you?\nWe know (with some exceptions) most of our relations on mums side but not many on dads side. As a matter of fact, he hasn’t many at all.\nThere were quite a few home guards on different stations when we came up to Tilbury but I don’t think they were guarding the stations, they seemed to be waiting around for a train. I thought the exercise was finished when we come back.\nI’m glad Margaret got on alright with her sailor friend, I wonder how long it will last now? \nI can’t think of any more news for the present so I’ll have to close up. I’m writing this in the same place as the last one as I’m on duty again.\nI hope you like the colour of the ink, I think it looks O.K.\nGoodnight darling I’ll write again as soon as I can.

Its a bit awkward to write a decent letter without one to answer isn’t it. I’m sorry.\nYes dear this is the last night i shall be on duty for a fortnight. The fortnight has gone by pretty quickly to me, mainly because I suppose we have been pretty well occupied. Ellas boy is certainly very lucky but\n[letter illegible]\nthe holiday money, perhaps the directors want to buy a new car or something. I suppose they have given some excuse for it, or have they? By the way you write it seems doubtful that you get it or not.\nI don’t think I’ll be able to come to the office from here on a 24 hrs and we can’t get away before 2 and according to the run of the trains I shan’t get home before 4:30. By the time I’ve had a cup of tea its 5 and I shouldn’t get to Liverpool street till round\n[letter illegible]\njob to pick the target up owing to poor visibility and the targets are very small and the sea is pretty big. Just as the lights picked it up and the operator reported ‘on target’ a message came through \"air raid\" and soon after the warning went. Ofcouse we had to close and stand down untill the all clear. Owing to the visibility we were unable to shoot off only half the rounds but it was a good shoot according to the Big nobs who came along to critisize it. I\n[letter illegible]\nI don’t yet know when I get my next 24 hrs. They have a new racket now of not telling us when we go on 24 hrs untill the day we are due to go. The shoot stopped the 24 hrs for 2 nights. It makes me think, theese AA sites, who are in action almost every night, get 24 hrs one a week and we get a blinking practice shoot and all ours are cancelled.\nI will close now as I’m afraid I can think of nothing more to write about. So goodnight darling and got bless you.\nYours for ever\nBern\n"

I told you it wouldn’t be far away, didn’t I? I never imagined for a second it would be in the blinkin infantry.\nSo Franks gone now, has he? They are all leaving England, whilst I’m still sitting pretty. (Well, not very pretty)\nI should have laughed you sent that cigarette end here, you must think I’m very hard up.\nMargarets chap may well mean well but he may be the sort thats out every night and keeps saying I’ll write tomorrow. Its strange but when one gets in with a croud of chaps, they keep taking you to go out and off you go. The letters get left.\nI expect it was a suprise when you saw I was only in Maidstone. I heard that I was going into infantry before they told us where we were going so I wasn’t so overjoyed when I heard Maidstone. Don’t worry dear I shan’t go abroad as soon as the training here is finished. I shall be posted to home forces and thats definate. The training here is a bit tough but as long as I’m in England I don’t mind in the least.\nTell Mr Lee that there is no hope of transfer. They have a good twist here. If you want a transfer back to the RA you must sign on for 7 years! The only things you can get in are the red caps, comandoes, or airbourne.\nI’ll buy you a new badge darling but not yet as we may shift into something else when we move. I was going to but you a new RA for Christmas but thats wrong now. \nYes dear all the 10 came here. No, they didn’t, I’m telling a lie! Two were stopped at the last moment as they had already volunteered for the navy and would be going in a few weeks. I wish now that I’d volunteered for that as I wouldn’t have been any worse off. I don’t fancy this lark.\nYes, I shall get my 48 hrs alright darling it will make a good break in between. I’ll be able to let you know the date in the next letter.\nMaidstone is not a bad place and we are about 20 minutes walk from the centre of the town. We can go out every night, except when we are on guard or room orderly when we have to stop in and look after the kit, blackouts, etc.\nOne of our officers from Grain is here. We saw him this morning. I expect he has been transferred the same as us.\nI expect I shall be bringing one of my mate with me on 48 hrs. Bud Hanagan lives too far away to get home so I expect mum will put him up for the night. \nThere is not much I can say about the training yet as we have been on ordinary marching and rifle drill up to yet. The drill is slightly different form the RA and also none of us have done very much of it lately. There are 30 in our squad and only two of them are not ex R.A.s.\nThis here is a general training center as well, and I feel sorry for some of the civies who have just come in limping about in boots. It reminds me of when I was called up. Some of them look like school children.\nI will close now darling and write to mum.\nGood night darling and god bless you.\nYours for ever,\nBern\nx x xxxxxx\n x x xxxxxxx\n x x xxxxxxx\n x x xxxxxxxx\n x x xxxxxxxx\n x x xxxxxxxxx \n x xxxxxxxxxx\n"

We’ve had two inspections by big pots which meant that the whole evening before was devoted to blancoing, brass cleaning, rifle, and sewing on new flashes and titles, \"QUEENS\". I have also been on guard once, that was Friday and unlike Grain there was no chance to write then as the guard room on that gate is only a small hut and we are packed in like sardines. Yesterday we fired our rifle and I was the afternoon getting it clean again. We went out on night op. on Wednesday going over fields and woods in the dark. We went out about six and came back at 9:30. We got hardly any time to write at all as you can see by what I’ve just written but you can be assured darling that I’ll write when ever I can. I believe you know that, don’t you dear?\nAfter this ten weeks are over I expect I shall get more time so untill then don’t expect too many and I’ll do my best. Thank you for your letters dear please remember I didn’t wait several days before writing, theres no waiting here at all. As for not posting it, I gave it to a chap who was going but the following day to post it as I thought it might go quicker than the camp post but evidently he forgot to post it. I shan’t do it again. I always have told you I’ll write whenever I can darling.\nThere is a chap here who has been transferred from the R.A.F. He was an observer and got grounded because of his nerves. He was discharged from the RAF one day and called in the army the following day. Don’t worry dear I shall not volunteer for anything. I still that I’d put my name in for the navy though.\nI hope to get my 48 hours in a fortnights time. That will be the weekend after next. The next fortnight will soon go by.\nI’m sorry if I cross out too well. I can’t remember what it was so it couldn’t have been very important dear. I’ll have a look at it next time I;m home and maybe it will come back to me.\nWe also have had the waring here two or three times since I’ve been here. The siren is very confusing here as they also have a \"raiders over\" and a \"raiders past\" signal. The former is cook-o sound and the latter is a series of short blasts.\nOur training is just about the same as when I last wrote. We don’t start the real tough stuff for another week and as yet we are still doing drill, plenty of P.T., LMG, and small arms training. \nI will dry up now dear as I’ve run out of news and I must write to mum. Then I’ll have a bath, clean up for tomorrow, and go out after tea. Cheerio darling even though letters are fewer I still love you as much as ever.\nBye bye darling god bless you\nYour ever loving\nBern\n"

I hope you are not too angry with me for not writing and forgive me. I’ll not give any excuse as I’m always giving excuses and I suppose it is getting a bit tame by now. You wouldn’t believe me anyway.\nIn Saturday 27s letter there is really nothing to answer as you’re telling me off the whole way through. Its a good job you wasn’t in a temper! If you really think I’ve been out enjoying myself every night you may as well continue to think so.\nThank you for going round to mums place. It certainly is a pity that dad wont be up next week-end when I shall come home. I shall try and meet you at Ilford station if I get up in time on Friday night. Otherwise I shall be round as soon as I can. The passes are already made out so lets hope this week slips by pretty quickly dear.\nNo darling honestly, we are getting very few raids here. We’ve had about 3 since we came down here. I have only heard the guns once and that was in the distance.\nPlease excuse the paper but I just discovered I was on the last sheet so tore a page from one of the books that I put my signallers notes in. I’ll not get any ink whilst I’m here as I’ve no where to put it and I should only have to dump it when I move. Its dangerous to carry ink around, it may get broken.\nLee can go on kidding you that I would sign on for 7 years. I certainly want not while I have you to come back to darling.\nWe went over the assault course this morning for the first time. Its not too hard but quite bad enough, if you know what I mean. Mind you, we went over light where as in the final test we go over in equipment & rifle after a 6 mile march. Some of the chaps were a bit nervy. One of them couldn’t do 2 of the obsticals and they had him up on one of them for about an hour, with the officer and corporal coaxing him but he wouldn’t do it. He was standing there shaking like a leaf. It does look very frightening at first with 20 feet to drop if you miss.\nWe go on a 10 mile route march tomorrow. That will be the first route march here. The longest one I’ve ever done is 5 miles! I’ve been a lot further than that hiking, though I used to like walking but maybe after theese 10 weeks I shall not be so keen.\nI’ve been thinking, if I had still been at Grain I should not have got my leave untill Jan 3, where as now I have had 6 days and get another about Jan 23. Not too bad is it? Most of the chaps who got 6 days with me are getting the other 3 days with their 48 hrs and are going tomorrow night. Unfortunately I wasn’t due for another 9 days when I got that 6, so I only get my bare 48. Never mind darling I’m doing pretty well for leave.\nI will close now as I’m getting near the end of the sheet. My love to everyone dear and will see you next week end. Bye bye for a while\nYours\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nPte Shepherd\nE Coy 3 Platoon\n13th ITC\nInvicta Lines\nMaidstone\n\nMy Darling,\nI arrived back safely on Sunday night with out mishap. We got to Strood, where a Maidstone train was waiting and within a few minutes we were on our way to Maidstone. It was just quarter to ten when we got into camp, so we had 1 ½ hours to get straighted up in as \"Lights out\" is 11:15 on Sundays. During the week lights out is at 10:15 but Sundays it is an hour later.\nWe were up at the range all yesterday and was it cold? I was almost frozen stiff. We don’t get know the results of our shooting but I bet the percentage wont be too high. I know mine wont be, anyway, I never was much good with a rifle.\nToday we had the much dreaded indurance test. It wasn’t nearly as bad as was expected but ofcourse quite enough. We were running then marching, then running etc. for nearly 2 hours and finished up by going over the assault course. At the assault course we had to wait while those in front went over the first obstical and ofcourse got out wind back. Therefore it wasn’t too bad.\nI am writing this, as I am on duty tonight, in the P.A.D. shelter. I am what everbody except the army calls a firewatcher. We do 2 hours on and 6 off so its not too stiff, I couldn’t write last night as we had to clean our rifles and bren guns which we had been firing. Tomorrow night we are out on night opperations so theres no time then.\nThe weekend soon passed by didn’t it dear? I hated leaving you at the station Sunday night. It seemed that I had only just said Hello when I had to leave you again. To think that a man started this war so that thousands like ourselves should be parted against our will. It makes me feel bitter when I think of it.\nI will close now dearest, as I think I’ll get a bit of shut eye before I go out at 11:30. I’ll write whenever I can dear even though you may not believe me.\nGoodnight darling believe me dear I am\nYours for ever\nBern\n"

We have had a pretty full week, although we did get Thursday night off. We went swimming Thursday afternoon and as we were already in Maidstone we stopped there for the evening.\nThank you for Mondays letter dearest. Glad you got back safely without mix-up. You shouldn’t have lost your way at Woolwich as there is nothing much in it. Straight down Powis street, then first right.\nI’m afraid I have let you down darling. I simply cannot think of anything in the way of presents for anyone, not even myself. I had a look arround Maidstone yesterday but it was hopeless. I couldn’t even get any christmas cards. Anything I did see was about 5 or 6 pounds or involved coupons.\nI went to the pictures yesterday and saw a very unusual film. It was a french film with french talkie and it was translated into english in writing underneath. By the dressing I should think its a pretty old film and the story was good and could be understood OK. The other film was ‘turnabout’ which was pretty okey doke. Bud turned up queer in the pictures and we had to come straight back. He has been in bed all the morning with violent stomach aches which are unexplainable as I ate the same as he and I have had no effects thank goodness.\nIt has been raining here practically all the morning. It was coming down so hard that I never went for any breakfast this morning. Some of the lads went early and came back soaked and all they got was a little piece of bacon and half a dozen chips, therefore I are some chocolate instead.\nThe 15 mile route march we had on Wednesday made my feet a trifle sore but they are alright now except for a piece of skin off my small toe, left foot. We have another tomorrow.\nI must close now darling as I must write to mum, I have not written home yet since I had my 48 hrs and they will wonder what has happened to me.\nBye bye dearest, I love you more than you ever imagine and someday I hope to convince you how strong my love is for you \nYours for ever\nBern\nXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nPte Shepherd\n3 Platoon\nE Company\n13th ITC\nMaidstone\n\nMy Darling,\nThank you greatly dear for the cigarettes & letters that arrived safely. I’m sorry I am once again a long time in writing. I feel a proper beast with everyone sending me parcels etc. and I havent even sent a christmas card. Saturday afternoon which was the only possible time of getting, it was absolutely impossible to get any. We went round all the shops which were all sold out. One chap managed to get one and he paid 3/6 for it. What a price! Maidstone was packed to capasity on Saturday. I went out on Monday but all the shops were shut by the time I got out. I’m sorry dear.\nI recieved the money from Bucks safely and I will answer them, when I’ve written this, on a different type of paper. It would look bad if I answered on their paper. I recieved £1 from the firms collection and as you know 30/- from B.L. It was a great surprise to get that amount and very good of the staff.\nThe training is getting stiffer than ever here but thankgoodness the time is slipping slow but sure. Wednesday we had a 12 mile march, today and indurance test and monday an 18 miler.\nI expect you are getting all ready for tomorrow where you are. Just now they played all the carols on the wireless. It reminded me of the times we used to have and the tunes we shall have after the war. Christmas in the army isn’t a great deal. The cookhouse is decorated very well and even has a hugh christmas tree in there. I expect we shall have a few drinks tomorrow night. I hope the dinner tomorrow is a bit better than usual.\nPlease excuse the writing if you cannot understand it but theres some chaps sitting on it which makes it almost a rocking horse.\nThey had a pantomime here acted by chaps and girls from the camp. It was jolly good indeed and we had the evening off to see it. It was Aladdin and lasted from 7:30 untill 10. It was held in the NAAFI which is large and has a nice stage. The costumes we grand and in all it was as good as an outside show.\nI have plenty of letters to write now. 7 in all and I hope to get most of them done tonight and tomorrow morning.\nI must close now darling. Although it will be too late by the time you recieve this I wish you the grandest christmas you have ever had. Lets hope that I am home next year when we shall realy go mad. I shall anyway. \nStill, there are chaps here who have not had a christmas at home for 4 or 5 years so I can’t shout too loudly.\nGoodnight darling I am looking forward more every day to the time when we are together again for ever.\nAll my love dearest\nYours\nBern\nXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

Glad to say I got back safely last night, although I had to wait some time at Gravesend for a train. I missed the other owing to the Tilbury line being about 20 minutes late. I got into camp at 10:15 which was ample time to make my bed, change my washing, and straighten up for the morning.\nWe (John & I) have just come back from a café just outside the gate where we had a fish & chip supper. We could not go to the NAAFI tonight as per usual because the pantomime ALADIN is being shown again. It is on for 3 nights and civys are invited.\nPoor old Bud is on front gate guard now. They were given the whole day off to get ready for it and everything had to be just so. I don’t quite know how he got on with the guard mounting as I havent seen him since. He was having a good old moan before he went on.\nTomorrow night we are on night ops. The serjeant told us last week that we had done all our night ops but we are still doing them.\nOur platoon is on duty Wednesday night and I expect I shall catch them as I have not done a night duty since xmas eve. I was on duty on Sunday but, although they were also on duty, the boys saw me square. One of them paraded twice.\nIts rather cold here tonight, its very bright out with the full moon though. Bed is about the warmest pace and I shall get in about half past nine, I think.\nI have lost the writing paper that you sent down. I bet you are calling me all the names under the sun. I didn’t realise it untill tonight when I went to write. When I went on that 4 day scheme I put it in my resperator. All the resperators were brought back in the truck as we were doing that 10 mile forced march. They got mixed up and mine was taken into the other platoon hut and someone must have seen the book in it. I surmise thats what happened anyway.\nI’ve read through a whole pile of your letters that I havent answered and there is nothing of any importance to answer except about my xmas present. You have already bought my present dear those cigarettes so please don’t buy any thing else.\nI got disapointed today, I put in for a statement of accounts last week and they came through today. I expected to get atleast a couple of quid and only have 15/5 in credit.\nWell darling I think I will close now. Its only just over a fortnight untill I’m home again, so goodnight dear you are for ever in my thoughts,\nYours,\nBern\nxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxx\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nPte Shepherd\n3 Platoon\nE Coy\nInvicta Lines\nMaidstone\n\nMy dearest Kath,\nThank you dear for Wednesdays letter and this stationary. If you had not sent this I should have had to go on the borrow again as the NAAFI (as usual) had no writing paper. I think it would be a good idea to introduce a new word to the English language - \"Naafi\" meaning \"the worst possible\".\nI had a piece of good news on Wednesday - I, and eight others, were told that we’d be on front gate guard on Friday night but luckily it was altered to a fire picquet. I was going to write last night as I was on duty but I was on from 7 untill 9 and by the time I had supper it was bed time. I was on again from 2 untill 4 this morning.\nI’m sorry about the mark \"nothing of importance\" in your letters dear. When I glanced thro’ my letter after I had written I noticed it but didn’t alter it at all as it would have made a mess. Then you would have been puzzling your head as to what was underneath. I knew you would understand that I didn’t realy mean what I had written.\nThere is no nead to worry about that key dear if you havent taken it round, as they are not in any great need of it and I shall be home in almost a weeks time.\nI’m glad Eddie is enjoying his course slightly more than I am but I expect he is looking forward to the week after next as much as I am. My leave starts on the 27th and shall probably be able to get away Wed afternoon.\nThe case that mum has given you is a very good idea darling. I had thought of getting a few things in but I couldn’t think of the sort of things to get. Maybe you can serjest a few things dear. I know exactly what it will be like after the big bang is over dear so I don’t think the shock will be quite so big. No more that about 5000 volts, I hope.\nIts bitter cold here today with ice and Jack Frost hanging arround everywhere. Luckily I dodged the RSMs drill parage this morning thro’ being on duty last night. The boys who were on it were frozen stiff when they came back. I got out of it last week when it was pouring with rain because of the inoculations. We’ve been out in it most of the morning though.\nI should have my overcoat and gloves on writing this letter as its like a cold storage room in here. The fire is right up one end of the room and the table the other so there is no chance of any heat here.\nI went out on Thursday night as we were on swimming and already in town at 5 o’clock. We saw quite a decent film \"The house of mystery\".\nI cannot think of anything else to write about just now darling. \nAll my love dearest, only another 11 days.\nBye bye,\nYours for ever\nBern\nxxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx\n"

I have just come off head quarter guard. Its the worst guard I’ve ever been on. What with the lack of sleep last night and the dashing about today I feel just about all in. I’m glad its over anyway.\nThank you for sundays letter darling. I suppose you didn’t get saturdays letter untill monday.\nYes, the fog here was pretty think last week end but I’ve been told it was nothing like London. The Boys on weekend pass had a job to get back but they managed it. Busses didn’t run down here.\nWhat did Beryl and Vic think of the Palladium? Whos up there?\nI’m sorry dear but my mind it a bit blank and I can’t think of anything else to write about. Only another week today and I shall be home. We are going after duty on Wednesday so expect me during the evening.\nGoodnight darling all my love\nJust yours,\nBern\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\n"

I did get it and a jolly good job I did. There is another HQ guard for us at the week end but ofcourse I don’t catch it as I did the last one. Flanagan has copped it again as there isn’t enough chaps left who havent done a guard.\n5 of our chaps left here the day before yesterday to go to a P.T. camp to toughen them up. They were the chaps who made a poor show on the 10 mile forced march. \nI didn’t see the report in the paper about the Ilford train smash but I suppose there were quite a few casualties. Marvelious line, that! I think it is pretty definate that I should be home Wednesday night. I hope sargeant young has not had his leave cancelled.\nWe had our battle inoculation yesterday. That is the thing I told you about where we had to go into \"Attack\" while they were firing over our heads and explosive going off all round us. I turned up queer in the afternoon and reported sick. I’m excused of all duties with a touch of the flu. I report sick again tomorrow. I’m feeling alot better now. I shall be all right or Wednesday, you can bet.\nI’m afraid that is all for tonight so I must close. I’ll be seeing you in six days time.\nGoodnight dearest\nYours for ever,\nBern\nxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxx\n\nPS sorry dear that I’m late in posting this owing to circumstances out of my control (loud cough). Anyway darling I’ll write again tomorrow. I’m afraid there has been a mistake of the leave date darling I’ll be home Thursday night instead of the original Wednesday.\nYou must blame our blinking sargeant for that, he told us the wrong day.\nGoodnight dearest, I’ll post this in the morning for sure.\nYours,\nBern\nxxxx\nxxxx\nxxxx\nxxxx\n"

I missed the early train from Gravesend as the train to Tilbury was late and also the ferry took a terrible time to get in, mainly I think because the water was rough.\nWe’re not stopping here another week or so as I said when I was home. We are moving to depot company (which is just down the road) in the morning. They usually stop down there about a week before being posted so ofcourse I havent the faintest idea of where I am going. Don’t worry darling it wont be far.\nIts been murder today hanging arround with kit inspections, changing and drawing kit and in general hanging arround all the drafty corners they could find for us. We were hanging arround in just shorts and overcoat for 2 hours waiting for a health inspection which we should have had at 2 and didn’t get until 4 o’clock.\nHow are they at home darling? I’ve been thinking about it all day. Please tell me the truth dear as I should only worry if I thought you wasn’t. I know you will anyway as you promised at the station. Maybe I’m not up to the standard which I should like to be dear but all I know is I love you and I shall always do my best for you dear. It was quite a blow for me when you told me on Wednesday. I know I was not up to your mothers expectations but little did I realise I was as bad as that. It was the rest of the family which I think suprised me the most. I wouldn’t mind so much if it didn’t affect you so much darling. You will be almost an outlaw to your own family, a thing that I wouldn’t have thought possible. I’m certain I could never feel that way towards anyone of my family no matter what happened. If only we could change places for a while. You have certainly proved your love for me dear which I never have doubted. I wish I could write on paper how much I love you too dear but I’m no good at writing and even if I could it would still be as equaly impossible. I cannot bear think of anyone upsetting you darling or your enjoyment, and when I think of it I feel like smashing everything at hand but that would be no use whatsoever, would it dearest? Try and get friendly with them again dear for your own sake. It will be life for you at all otherwise darling. Remember you are always welcome at No. 40 dear and any night you feel lonesome just go round. I’m afraid I’ve been rambling on anyhow tonight dear but I can’t write about anything else. I hope it doesn’t make you any worse by reading this, if so please forgive me.\nIf possible I will write again tomorrow and give you the address darling but I wont promise as we are moving.\nI only wish it was this time last week darling when there was no need to write for a whole week - with you by my side nearly all the time. Goodnight darling I’ll be thinking of you the whole time. Yours, Bern\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nx x\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

Ofcourse I did not get your letter that you send to Maidstone as I moved quicker than I antisipated, so I am still wondering how you are getting on at home. I shall say no more about it now darling although I cannot forget it as I am sure I said enough last time, and mum may be alright again now.\nWe left Maidstone on Monday morning at nine o’clock and caught a train from Euston about 1200. I would have phoned you dear had I had suficient time but there wasn’t. We never stopped near a phone box anyway. We arrived in Lancaster before 6 and although it was a long journey it passed pretty quickly with the boys.\nThe barracks is not too bad here, its quite modern and up to date with central heating in the huts, wash house, lavatory and showers connected to the hut, so that one does not have to venture outside in theese cold mornings (It is cold here too). The food is tons better that Maidstone ever thought of cooking and everything is clean and smart. Mind you, this is only a small place with only about 100 to 150 men including permanent staff I overheard one of the officers saying that this was the most men they had had here. Lancaster (so we’ve been told) is quite a nice place, although the impression I got coming through it last night in the dark wasn’t too good. They say there are dozens of red caps knocking arround.\nWe’ve done nothing today except having two or 3 lectures that they always give when you go to a fresh place. This afternoon we have been painting our brasses.\nI must dry up now, my dearest, and write mum and let her have my address. I am still with you dear although we are far apart and no matter how far away I may go I shall never stop loving you.\nGoodnight darling\nYours till the end of the world\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx\n\nPS. in case you can not read my address here it is\n10 Platoon\nB Coy\n13th The Queens Royal Reg\nBowerham Barracks\nLancaster\nLancs\n\nI opened the envelope to put this in.\n"

I have only yet recieved one of your letters from Maidstone but I presume the other is on its way.\nI’m glad everything passed alright when you went back to work on Friday and Warren said nothing about having no certificate.\nI’m sorry mum is still keeping up her silent strike as you call it. She will get over it before long (untill I come on leave again)\nOfcourse I meant it when I suggested getting engaged dear. I never mentioned it in my last letter as I was leaving it a bit until my leave was getting near. The only trouble is it would make matters worse than ever with your mother but ofcourse dear that is entirely up to you. It will certainly give her something to think about! You can be sure darling I shall never let you down.\n(Thursdays letter)\nLancaster, much to my supprise, is a city, although, from what I saw last night, there isn’t very much to do there for troops. A fourpenny bus ride away is a place called Morecombe which, so I’m told, is a \"Southend\". I shall be visiting there one weekend.\nYes, Bud and the rest of them are here with me. We all kept together and were put in the same platoon. Our platoon was divided in to 3 sections and all of the old 3 platoon boys got in the same one.\nI am running short of stationary dear but you need not bother to send any down as I will get some from the NAAFI.\nMy co-op no. is 3,8795 dear.\nWe havent realy started our training yet but from what I’ve heard of it its pretty tough. When we have done this we are fully trained infantrymen and goodness knows where we shall go then.\nIts pretty cold up here just now, although it hasn’t been raining. We have been issued with an extra blanket so we are not cold in bed. The sun has been shining gloriously up here every day practicaly but there is very little warmth in it. It looks like a lovely hot day but feels slightly different. For the training, though, the weather is ideal as we soon get hot enough chasing arround.\nWe had a cross country run Saturday which the whole Regiment took part in. There were roughly 500 in it and it was for about 5 miles. I came in 199th. One of the sargeants came in first. It was over ploughed fields, up banks, over walls, etc. and we all got up to our eyes in mud. The whole place is very wet and boggy all arround here.\nI started this letter Sunday but I’m afraid its Monday now dear. Whilst I was writing one of the chaps recieved his accordian which he had sent home for and ofcourse it drew me like a magnet. I was watching him play as he is pretty good and then had a go myself and didn’t realise the time going. The next I new my mates were ready and waiting for me to go out. We saw \"Sullavens Travels\" and another about 15 years old. I’ve never seen a place like this for cinimas. There is only one decent place which is the Odeon.\nI received Saturdays letter today darling with the enclosed list. I have had no time to study it yet but I’ll let you know what opinion I have formed next time I write which I hope will be Wednesday.\nI am glad you have for what you wanted - a costume. The price isn’t too bad either, I’m sure I shall like it dear if you choose it.\nYou had a raid Friday night, eh? It seems strange to me as usualy when you have one I have one too but they don’t know what raids are here.\nI recon girls are mad who are marrying the allied forces. Still its up to them and no one else.\nI must say goodnight now darling as there is nothing to talk of now and its time I made my bed down.\nGoodnight darling all I have it yours\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

I’m sorry I’ve been quite a while in writing again darling and I have nothing except the old excuse which, although its out of date, is perfectly fine.\nI’m very pleased to hear that mum is \"coming round abit\". Mybe she will be alright in a week or two. I suppose she will be alright untill she is told of our getting engaged.\nNow I’m going to shock you by giving you the reason why I wrote and scratched out \"I think you have made a slip\". You put in your letter \"I even dreamt you were in scotland last night\". When I first read it I mistook even for \"never\" and consiquently thought you were suggesting that Lancaster was in Scotland. On reading it through for a second time I discovered my error, hence the scribble.\nAs for the other time I can’t remember what that was, I was something equaly ridiculas anyway.\nLancaster is a decent size for a town but not for a city. Its got shops of all sizes, thousands of houses, offices and factories but theese are not much good to pass the time away. It has 3 YMCAs or similar canteens, I believe 5 cinimas and only one dance hall as far as we’ve found out. I don’t dance so thats out of the question, ½ of the films I’ve seen as they are all old, and one can hardly spent there whole time in the canteen. Morecombe, where we visited yesterday, isn’t too bad. All the fun fair etc. is all closed or else we should have realy enjoyed ourselves. Anyway, we had a good look round and the beer tasted OK. We caught a train back about 10:30.\nIt is cold up here dear and been trying to snow for the last week but didn’t succeed. It is coming down now slightly.\nI have another 4 weeks training here then we are fully trained. We should then get our leave so I wondered whether you could arrange it with Warren for your holidays dear. It should be a month on Monday when my leave starts but its not definate. There is also a possibility darling when we have finished here as first class infantry that we may get 14 days leave. I have to have to say this dear but it is better to say it now than to spring it upon you at the last moment. Even if I get 14 days I may not go overseas as there are thousands who have had embarkation leave 3 or 4 times. I thought it best to mention it dear incase you have overlooked the possibility. Now lets forget it dear and think of at least 7 days in a months time.\nIt is almost dinner time now dear so I had better finish on this page. I’ve been ready for dinner for the last hour. I have the apetite of a horse ever since I came up here. I may have a big dinner and within an hour I’m raving hungry again!\nI almost forgot about the photo which I think is quite good and I really can’t see anything wrong with claud.\nI hope dear by the time this reaches you mum will be her old self again. Bye bye darling.\nYours, Bern\n"

We’ve had a hectic week with no time to ourselves and I’m glad that it is Saturday tomorrow so that we may get away from it for a day + a half. Monday eve we were all on the range and stopped there to do night firing. We got back to camp at 20 past 11 and by the time we’d had dinner, cleaned our arms, etc. it was getting on for one. Tuesday during the day we fortified a hill and had to defend it at night against an attacking platoon. We got back at 10:30. Wednesday there was a concert on so they let us get back early. It wasn’t too bad either. All semi clasical but worth listening to. Yesterday was quite decent up on some moors except that the whole place was flooded. Today has been awfull but we did at least get back by tea time. Here they even pay us during our own time! They pay us at 6 o’clock.\nThank you for Saturdays and Mondays letters darling sorry I havent answered them before and hope you havent been worrying.\nI’m afraid I’ve no sympathy for the pay corps doing PT in shorts! I suppose they go in if it starts raining. I don’t think my legs are much different from anyone elses. I’ve never realy taken much notice of them myself as I’m not in the least bit interested in mens legs.\nI havent the faintest idea how many pubs there are in Lancaster as I haven been in one of them. I went in one Morecombe last weekend as there was nowhere else to go. Money doesn’t permit too many of those haunts.\nBud doesn’t seem to be too short of dancing as the weekend is practicaly the only time we can get out and he pops off them to either Morecombe or the one in Lancaster.\nI’m not realy struck on wearing a ring darling but if you want to buy me one I’ll have to change my mind. I don’t realy mind dear.\nThere is a dance at the Barracks here tonight and most of the boys have gone so the room is pretty quiet. I bet it’ll be pretty noisy at midnight when the jig finishes.\nWe have another cross country run tomorrow which I’m not looking forward to a bit. I feel stiff as a poker now. They say its only 3 miles but last time they said it was 3 and turned out to be nearly six.\nIts nearly 10 o’clock now so I’m getting to ged and hope I get no rude awakening during the night.\nGoodnight my dearest, I am always thinking thinking of you and I always will.\nGoodnight\nYours for ever\nBern\nxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxx\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nPte B Shepherd\n10 Platoon\nB Coy\n13 Q R R\nBowerham Bks\nLancaster\n\nDearest Kath,\nThank you darling for Saturdays and Mondays letters. I’m sorry I don’t write half the number of letters that you do dear but its not because I don’t want to. I don’t just say \"hang her, I’ll go out instead of writing to her tonight\" as some of your letters indicate. Please remember darling I always write whenever possible. I’ll have to address my letters to the firm, then you wont be late and miss your train.\nI’m glad you spoke to Rene about our engagement. It must be very awkward for you to tell mum dear and I wish I could help you in some way but there isn’t much I can do, is there darling?\nGlady would have been a different person altogether if she had married instead of living with Mrs Sharpe. I don’t think you will look as old as her when you are 30 dear I shall see to that. I don’t think its frightening to get old when one has someone like you to grow old with. I’m sure I shall never get tired of you dear as the years roll but and I hope you will never of me. We’ll just grow old together.\nYou speak of buying cigarettes dear which reminds me to tell you that I no longer smoke. I have had only an occasional one for over 3 weeks and I am beginning to get used to it now, altho’ its still very tempting but I’m not craving for them so much as I did at first. I used to spend three parts of my wages on cigs and was alway broke so I packed it. I’ve spent all my money again this week but a bit more sencably.\nWill you congratulate Tim on passing his exam. I’ll have to get him to give me a few lessons some day. It doesn’t realy matter while I’m in the army as I don’t get much time as it is without going to dances.\nWe were out on Monday night again, this time we were disarming a mine field. There was snow on the ground 3 or 4 inches deep and by the time we had crawled the length of the field prodding it for burried mines we were frozen stiff & soaked through. We got back at 10:30.\nSunday afternoon it started to snow and by the evening it was pretty thick. It poured with rain last night but that failed to shift all of it and today it was all sloshy and muck. Yesterday we went out river crossing in colapsable canvas boats. The pond we went on for practise was covered with ice which we had to smash. Anyway, we got under way after about an hours ice smashing and one of the boats caught a sharp piece of ice making a 2ft slit in it. In parts this pond is 12 feet deep but luckily they were in a shallow part. Ofcourse the boys didn’t know this and as soon as the boat began to sink off came their equipment into the water. The water came to their waists and you can bet there were in a nice mess. Our boat went and rescued them and got pretty soaked ourselves, I thought every minute that our boat would colapse when they were getting in and with the extra load the water line was about an inch off the top.\nTomorrow we go out at 10 in the morning and midnight on an all day and night scheme, ‘company attack’. Its right on top of a hill about 8 miles away, I bet it’ll be cold tomorrow night.\nI must close now dear as its ten o’clock. In a quarter of an hour the lights will be out.\nAlthough I don’t often say it dear you must know how I love you with all my heart and no one could ever change it.\nGoodnight my dearest\nI’ll write again at the first oportunity.\nBelieve me darling\nI am \nYours forever\nBern\nxxxxx\nxxxxx\nxxxxx\nxxxxx\nxxxxx\nxxxxx\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nPte Shepherd\n10 Platoon B Coy\n13th Q R R\nBowerham Bks\nLancaster\nLancs\n\nMy Darling,\nThank you so much for your letters darling which I always look forward to so much. I’m so sorry I have not been able to write to you since last week darling and hope that you will forgive me. The reason for not posting Wednesdays letter untill Saturday is pretty simple. The post box in the camp is quite a distance away and I never had time Wednesday night to post it before lights out. We were out from 8:30 till late evening on Thursday and Friday untill the weekend.\nYes darling I do come on leave on the weekend after next which is the 18th. I am not quite sure whether it will be Saturday or Monday owing to some General coming down on Friday. We have to do a scheme for him that day and it may hold up our leave untill Monday.\nTo me this has been the quickest month I have known, I think. One would imagine that working all day and half the night would tend to drag the time but it is just the oposite.\nI am glad you have managed to put forward the date for your costume. I do hope you get it in time.\nWhat do you mean \"I have TRIED to give up smoking\"? I have given it up, not just tried. By spending more sensibly I mean that I can now go into the canteen etc. and not say to myself \"you can’t have that or you’ll have no smokes for the rest of the week\". I havent realised what harm they do to one untill now I’ve stopped it.\nWe were supposed to have been inspected by Monty whilst we were at Maidstone but some other grandfather with red tapes came instead.\nThe training is now gettings stiffer and stiffer. Its like a vice gradualy tightening up. Last night we slept on the top of a hill on the moors. All we had was one blanket and out overcoat so you can imagine what it was like. Snow is still laying arround up in the hills and last night was a thick frost. We had to shake the frost out of our blankets before getting to bed. The moment lay my head down tonight I know I shall just drop unconcious. The other day we practised jumping from a moving lorry. I jumped out 20 miles an hour in the end. An officer with us jumped out and missed his footing and broke his ancle. The sergeant had previously said \"it was imposible to break your ancle on it, the only thing you could break was your wrist!\"\nWe are trying to do our instructors in. One officer with a broken ancle, our officer, sprained ancle doing a jump and the CSM got shot yesterday with a blank cartridge. It burnt quite a bit of his side.\nThose blanks are dangerous at close quarters.\nI shall fall asleep here if I don’t get to bed now darling so I’ll close.\nGoodnight darling I’ll write again as soon as I can\nYours for ever\nBern\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx\n"

I hope you have recieved my Wednesdays letter as there seems to be a bit of a mix up. I gave it to a chap who can’t remember posting it. I suppose he did post it absent mindedly.\nI come on leave darling on Monday week which is the 20th, isn’t it? We should (if all goes to plan) catch a train about 12:30 on Monday so I shall be home in the evening. Our leave doesn’t actualy start untill Tuesday. The only thing that is being talked of now is leave (it is 14 days by the way). Next week is pretty tough training with a 3 days scheme but with 14 day to look forward to it wont be to bad. They have taken full particulars of where we are spending out leave so roll on Monday week.\nI’m pretty well stumped for news just now. Yesterday we went on a 10 mile forced march, the same as the Maidstone one, then cooked our dinner out in the field in mess tins. We then did a platoon attack over open country and marched back. We were just about all in upon getting back. Anway, the sargeant and corpral god 20 fags each from the officer over B company. He bet them we wouldn’t do it under 3 hrs as its all up hill. It took us 2 hrs and 5 minutes. One platoon took 5 hours to get all there men in.\nI havent realy had time to study that list that you made up dear. Its not because I am not interested in it darling I just havent time. I have 101 things to do. I havent a clean pair of socks, every pair of them have holes in (they were all washed and darned last week end). My Greatcoat is splashed over with mud which we got on training and so it my other battledress trousers, my gloves want darning, I’ve a pair of boots mudded up to the ancles, I’ve 3 more letters to write and I could think of tons more if I looked round. We fire our rifles practicaly every day and ofcourse they have to be boiled out and cleaned for the morning inspection. Everything has to be just right every morning as there is a company commanders inspection so you can see how much time we get. The early nights we clean up to make time for when we are on night ops. Never mind, its nearly over now.\nThere is one thing, we have had grand weather up here realy. Although its been cold and snow has been arround, we have had very little rain and the sun has been shining like summer except there is no warmth in it. It has looked cheerful which makes all the difference.\nI’m afraid I feel the cold even less now than before dear and after sleeping next week I shall be even more so. Its marvelious how one doesn’t catch cold after laying on wet grass, going through water waist high, sleeping in the open all night etc. I bet I’ll catch one when I come on leave!\nWell dear I must close now dear and go and have some tea.\nBye bye, I’ll post this letter this evening. Be seeing you in a weeks time\nYours for ever\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

There was plenty of room in the Euston train and, with the other boys, the time passed pretty quickly. We have had an half an hours wait at Preston and the train was pretty well packed but as it is only about ½ an hours ride to Lancaster it didn’t realy matter.\nThere are 3 who havent come back, one is Jonny Kirk. I expect they have got an extention somehow. The reason we never saw alot of the boys yesterday afternoon was that they caught the 2:40 which got in about eight. When I got back they had sorted all my kit out and reserved a bed for me so I was O.K. Bud got in early and dumped his kit and went to a dance. Ofcourse he didn’t have a very long train journey and I expect he felt like it.\nThank you dear for the grand time you gave me during the last 3 weeks. I could never have enjoyed myself so much without you and I would give anything for this war to finish so that we could be together for ever darling.\nIt will be alright dear for you to send down the ring as we are here for some time yet. You had better put on it though \"if undelivered return to -\" just in case of mishap.\nThe weather is almost as it was in London yesterday but a bit cloudy - sorry, its just started raining.\nI’ve just been to dinner in the hope that I should be able to find something to write about but I havent. I sorry dear but I forgot to ask you whether you got home safely yesterday. It must have been terrible for you traveling back on your own. I know what it is to sit in a train on ones own and just think. It wasn’t so bad with the chaps.\nI expect you will get this Tuesday morning - just before you go to work. I wish you all the best of luck in the world darling and if worrying helps at all dear you’ll get plenty from me.\nI hope dear that now you have no douts in your mind about how much I love you. I have always known that you douted me when I said I loved you but I do hope darling that you realise what you mean to me now. If only you knew how I felt now darling it would explain everything that I would like to say now, if I could only find the right words.\nBye bye darling I’ll write again very soon.\nYours for ever\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxx\n"

I’m afraid this will be fairly short as we are going to the pictures tonight but I’ll write again tomorrow for sure. I’ll write tomorrow afternoon which, ofcoarse, we have off. I’m so sorry that the letter you recieved from me was screwed up but it was forgotten and followed me round in my pocket all one day and it wasn’t untill after I was out that I remembered it so it was impossible to put on a fresh envelope.\nI am very suprised and pleased darling to find that Warren said very little to you about having the time off. Although I wanted you to have the time off very much, I hated to think that you might have to stand the consiquences (spelt wrong) when you went back.\nI was sorry to hear that my ring wasn’t ready on Wednesday as the sooner I get it the better as we’ve no idea when we may move. I shall be here on Monday though, so it will be alright.\nI will tell you all the news tomorrow when I write darling and will finish up tonight by saying I love you. I shall never be able to describe how much but it is like a furness inside of me which cannot go out. Every five minutes of the day something crops up and reminds me of you and I go drifting into space wishing what seems almost an impossiblity, that this was over and we were together for ever - never to part.\nGoodnight my dearest, I shall always love you with all my heart,\nYours for ever\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx\n"

We went to Morecombe for the day as the weather was so grand. We left here about 12 o’clock.\nThank you very much for sending the ring darling which I got today. Its very nice, isn’t it? I am glad I got it before I went away as I should have hated to go without it. Luckily we are here for an other week or more so there was actually plenty of time but ofcourse we didn’t know that then.\nThank you for all your lovely letters dearest, I’ll endeavour to answer them now if time permits. \nYes darling I was feeling just the same as you were whilst that train was steaming out of Euston. I shall never forget that dear will you?\nHow are you going with the cigarette cut down? I bet your smoking more than ever. I’ve cut it down quite a bit again but how do you think I’d look with a pipe? I’ve a good mind to try it again.\nJohn came back alright dear he got in Monday morning. He put up a pretty good excuse and only got 7 days CB. The other chap was alright as his sister whos only 22 got knocked down and killed.\nI can’t understand Glady - about our engagement I mean dear - apparently she doesn’t agree with it but I can’t understand her acting as she did and not turning up at the party.\nI wondered whilst at canvey whether you had told grandad that we were engaged but I didn’t say anything. I thought that perhaps you had written before.\nWe are still doing training here just the same as before we went on leave. I think that they are trying to get us browned off - and succeeding. We took off our \"QUEENS\" from our tunics last week and also painted the brasses on our belts. Today we are told that we are in the \"salute the soldier parade\" and brasses have to be polished and \"queens\" to be sewn on and whitened. Thats next Saturday afternoon at Blackburn which is about 25 miles from here and we have a nice coach ride there. Ofcoarse everything will have to be tip top being the Queens.\nI must close now darling before the lights go out. I still love you darling as much as ever and I am craving to see you again which I hope will soon be.\nGoodnight darling remember me to mum and all at 59.\nYours for always,\nBern\nxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxx\n"

I don’t deserve it dear but I know you will forgive me, wont you?\nThank you for going round to see mum. The lighter evenings will soon be here now and it wont be so dark to go home then. Summer is almost here. We are having some glorious weather here and the worst of it is it intices me to go out too much.\nAre you still behind with your work through the fortnights holiday darling?\nWhen the income tax comes off of your overtime I suppose there is very little left.\nWe saluted the soldier at Blackburn and there were crowds all along the streets. We had to march about a mile and a quarter and we (the Queens) led the whole possession. There was only one fault and that was the line of Police which marched in front. They marched too slow and when we went round corners we were marking time.\nWe got back at quarter past six and then went to the pictures. \nYesterday afternoon we went to Morecombe and spent the afternoon on the front and in the fair. In the evening we saw \"The Fallen Sparrow\". Altho the title isn’t very apetising the film was good and nothing like the title. \nWe came out about 9 and walked or rather started to walk to Lancaster but managed to get a lift in a Milk van. We had a ½ hrs wait for a train and so we decided to walk.\nI can’t think of any more news now darling. I certianly would not be much use as a newspaper reporter, would I? Still, I hope it wont be long before we no longer have to talk to each other in letters. Then we shall be together for always and all our little dreams will come true. \nGoodnight darling I still love you as much as ever and always shall. I’ll write again very soon.\nYours for ever,\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

My last tuesdays letter darling I posted Wednesday night and it isn’t the old matter of forgetting to post them, its because I seldom get time in the morning. We are not like you who pass a Post Box every morning and if we should pass it when marching round we are not allowed to fall out of the ranks to post a letter. My Memory isn’t quite bottomless, Anyway, I’ll post this one tonight as its early yet. \nSo you’ve given up smoking, I don’t believe that will last for long, especially if you smoke when they are given you. I have not smoked since last week end but I’ll see if I can get a pipe on friday. We should have next friday afternoon off if everything goes OK. There is a COs kit inspection tomorrow and if it is OK we get Friday afternoon off. I’ll say something if we don’t get it. We have got everything cleaned up for it.\nYou sound as though you were busy on Sunday emtying the mattress and generaly spring cleaning the bedroom. Blue and gold would be a wonderful colour for a bedroom darling that is provided its not a very cold room like mums. If I get the chance dear I’ll buy you a home that you will realy be proud of.\nWe have done very little training here since we’ve been back except for drill which we have had more than enough of. Mostly we are either having some of our kit checked and inspected or ourselves being inspected.\nDarling, you will have to put all the ideas out of your head that I might not go overseas. It is almost a certainty. We have been issued with overseas kit and are all ready to go at any time. I’m sorry dear that I still say after the war for our marriage but you never know I may change my mind but please let me do this spot of work over the other side first, then I’ll come back and then I shan’t say No to anything.\nWe are being mucked arround so much that I’m browned off. Last night we were confined to the Barracks to an education film at 8 o’clock about the invasion of the low countries. Altho’ I don’t want to go I shall be pleased when I see the back of this place.\nI will close now dear and write to mum else she’ll think I’m at the North pole or something. I havent written for well over a week.\nGoodnight darling all my love.\nYours for ever,\nBern\n"

Actually, I did write one on Sunday but it got screwed up in my pocket so I have it here beside me and I’ll transfer it to this letter.\nFirst of all darling I must tell you the good news - My draft have gone but I am still here at Lancaster. They left today, and I’ve felt terrible ever since. I don’t know what to do with myself, everywhere dead with all the gang gone. I had a slight axident (spelt incorrectly) last Friday. We got mixed up in a fight and I stopped a bottle with my head. I had to go to hospital and have 2 stitches in it and that stopped me from going. They took the stitches out this morning and it is healing up a treat so there is nothing to worry about. Its not even sore now. I have to hand my tropical kit in tomorrow so it doesn’t look as though I’ll be going yet and if there is half a chance I’ll get home but I wont promise darling.\nThank you for your letter dear I’m sorry I don’t write half the number of letters that you do darling and although I try to mind my ways something generaly turns up. Its not always because I go out - very often the army says no and its impossible to go against that. I should have more time now as I’m just a spare man, where they will shove me I don’t know. \nI hope darling that you are now catching up with the work which accumulated whilst I was home on leave and that Warren isn’t piling up too much on to you.\nI am sorry dearest, if my letters are not as long as they used to be but, believe me dear it isn’t because my love is getting thin. It is quite a difficulty for me to think of anything to put into your letters dear as the routine is always the same each day and only now and again does anything happen.\nI’m sorry dearest, if I am not the fellow that you thought I was. I have always known darling that you always thought only of my good points and never of my bad. I’m sorry I am unreasonable and have no decency but darling I never told you I was perfect or even good so please don’t blame me. I’m as bad (if not worse) as everyone else.\nEvery letter I have recieved from you dearest, for the last few weeks have been letting off steam with a 500lb pressure. One of these days I’ll have a go at replying with the same kind of ammunition and I bet I’d get a nice one back, don’t you darling?\nI am hoping dear that the next letter I recieve back will be a little different. Please darling.\nIt has rained here allday today untill tea time but it has cleared up now. All the week end was lovely and the sun was realy. \nI cannot think of any more dear just now but I still love you dear for all our differences.\nGoodnight darling xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nYours for ever xxxxx\nBern\n"

Here it has turned into rain and now that its started it doesn’t seem to know when to finish. It has also turned very cold and last night while I was on guard we almost froze with our greatcoats on. It is not raining now but it looks as though it may do so any minute and its certainly not very warm.\nI thought dear that your mother blamed me for enticing you to smoke and now she is encouraging you when you are trying to stop it. I never will understand the ways of women. They change there mind too much.\nThe MO has said nothing about the letter and I think I’ll let it slip for the time being. I don’t fancy it miles away from home anyway.\nYou seem to be quite busy in the garden and I hope you get plenty of Tomatoes from the plants and I only hope I’ll be able to get home to sample some when they are ripe. One can never tell.\nI’m sorry to hear that Rene is queer and I hope she is by this time feeling a lot better.\nDarling, I was certain I told you that we were issued with tropical kit and I have no intentions of not telling you dear. I am very sorry I forgot to mention it. Anyway, I havent got it now as, I believe I told you, I handed it in. I’m sorry if I upset you by not saying anything about it but it was quite unintentional darling.\nNo, Claude said nothing about the 10/- almost getting burnt but I am just guessing that I left it in my pocket. Did he give it to you? Yes, you’ll have to look after my money dear I love lighting fires with notes - it catches the coal better than Newspaper. You should try it some time (with someone elses money)\nNo, I I’ve not seen the pictures of the pre-fabricated houses but I can imagine they would be quite nice. We were talking the other night in the hut how an army hut such as we have here would make quite a nice home if sectioned off into rooms. I expect the pre F- houses will be much on the same scale as they are erected in the same way. \nI don’t know what we are going to do with the tons of plates that didn’t match! \nWe havent the faintest Idea where we move to when we go from here and 10 to 1 wouldn’t know untill we actualy got there. It was generaly thought throughout the noys who went that they were going to the place you mentioned but that was only a rumour.\nI don’t think I told you did I dear that we went for a tour round an aircraft factory last friday (not yesterday, week before). We had a very interesting time. Twelve of us went and two of the big noises took us round. They took us into the canteen and gave us a real slap up tea. What made it better was that we went on our own without any NCOs or officers.\nI’m not doing much here now. There is only about 20 or 30 of us here now. Practicaly all of them are NCO instructors. Then there are a few perminant staff and three who we left behind. One is me, one has trouble at home, his wife is ill and the other is waiting for a transfer as he is a cook.\nThe great disadvantage of having so few men is that the night duties are pretty heavy. Thursday I was on Fire picquet, Friday on guard and tonight I’m on Fire picquet again. I’m alright tomorrow, though and on Monday the O.C. has granted all B company with the whole day off. We have got a pass from revillie untill midnight and can go anywhere with it as long as we are back to time. Ofcourse its impossible to come home as it would take me all that time to get there and back. The order of the day is \"In bed or out of Barracks\". If the boys were still here we should have a good day out but I expect I’ll have a good lay in in the morning and visit the pictures during the afternoon. I’ll miss the boys terribly now that they have gone and it was terrible saying goodbye at the station as they were a grand set of chaps. I went as far as the station with them with full pack and everything incase an emergency turned up that they required an extra person. There were six of us who ever since we came back off leave always went out together and had all got on the same draft. (There were 2 drafts) But I missed it and with a stroke of luck I may be here a long time yet.\nI will finish off now darling. You know that I still love you madly and nothing will ever change me. I know you love me to dear as you have told me so and I would never dout your word in any respect darling.\nGod bless you dearest, and may we soon be together again.\nYours always,\nBern\nxxxx\nxxxx\nxxxx\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nPte B Shepherd\nB Company\n13 Q R R\n℅ GPO\nLancaster\n\nMy darling,\nThank you dear for Fridays and Saturdays letters.\nYes, you’ve hit the nail on the head. I would rather have gone with my mates than go with chaps I don’t know and the day that they went away I was hoping something would happen so that I could go. I have got over that now and don’t mind now but if I go within the next week or two I shall be wold. For the sake of a few weeks I’d rather have gone with the gang.\nMy head is quite OK now and all I have is a scab which I think will soon be comming off. It doesn’t hurt or anything now. Don’t worry dear I had worse knocks than that when I went to school.\nI hope Rene is better now and isn’t still lazing her life away in bed.\nI should imagine things such as tea services will be alot cheaper after the war than what they are now dear. The price of them is scandalious I think. I saw the pre-Fabricated houses on the films this week and they don’t seem to bad I suppose altho one cannot see what they are without visiting it. \nWe had a grand day here on Monday, our days holiday. I heard revillie go and just turned over, it was a wonderful feeling now to have to get up. I had a couple of pies in my cupboard and a corporal brought in a bucket of tea and I stopped in untill 10:15 when the company commander came in and tipped my bed over. Another chap and I walked down town, had something to eat in the YMCA and after looking round the shops came back to dinner. After dinner 4 of us went rowing on the river Loone and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The sun was glorious but it wasn’t too warm for rowing. (It never is realy hot up here). After tea we went to the palace and saw \"Madame Curie\" which ended a grand day very well. Yesterday I saw \"The man from down under\" which was also quite good.\n24 hours have passed since I last wrote on this sheet dear. I was writing it whilst on guard and was unable to finish it as I had to go on sentry. I only got 3 ½ hours sleep last night on that Bluepencil guard. Luckily it wasn’t very cold last night and it was moonlight. It has been a glorious day here today, the best so far. At dinner time I layed out in the sun on the grass outside the hut and went sound off to sleep. When I was awoken at 2 o’clock to start work I felt terrible. You know how you feel when you go to sleep in the day time. The sun is still shining grand now - right through the window at me.\nI didn’t tell you of the disaster which happened here a fortnight ago did I dear?\nA sergeant from one of the other companies was demonstrating to a platoon a anti-tank mine when it went off. The sergeant died 10 minutes after he was taken in the hospital. About a dozen others were injured but nothing serious and all of them are OK now.\nI sometimes lie in bed at night time and think of the things we shall do and where we shall go after the war is over darling and we are together. It is certainly something to look forward to. My thoughts are always running back to you darling whenever I get a few spare minutes to myself. That proves how much I love you dearest - a love which will never die.\nGoodnight darling.\nYours for ever,\nBern\nxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxx\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nPte B Shepherd\nB Coy\n13 Q R R\n℅ GPO\nLancaster\n\nMy Darling,\nThank you for your letters dearest, I’m sorry if I write about once a week, something always stops me from writing. I sorry dear. \nIt strikes me that its little use you working overtime with the income tax man snooping arround. I don’t quite understand the sentance \"I had to buy my tea so I’m worse off\". What tea is this? Ha! I get it now, you mean whilst you were working O/time. \nI’d like to lay a couple of bob that Eileen missed the bus on Thursday.\nMy head dear is absolutely alright now and you know I wont let you worry about me if I can possibly help it. Now, you need not worry anymore as it is perfectly OK.\nIt would be grand if I were home now, wouldn’t it darling especially if you were on holiday too. I was thinking of that only the other night in bed. Looking through the window where everywhere looked so calm and peaseful and was still pretty light I thought \"We should not be in bed just now if I was on leave. Then I thought of where we might be had I been home.\nIt was a lovely day here saturday and during the afternoon spent most of the time on the lawn outside the hut. I went off to the pictures in the evening.\nYesterday we went boating. It was very nice weather when we got there and being Sunday ofcourse the boating place was packed. There was no chance of getting 2 doubles. It came over dull and looked very much like rain soon after we got out but luckily it only spotted for a few moments.\nYou remember I said when I was on leave that some chaps got embarkation leave two or three times and that I might be one of them? Well it looks as though I shall not be going abroad for quite a time to come. You will have to get a new broach and put the Queens one with the RA as I believe I’m getting a transfer! This will mean that I shall be leaving Lancaster within a few days and should come alot nearer to London. What do you think I’m being transfered to? The Guards. It will mean plenty of polish and blanco but to keep in England for a few months longer and, I expect, another 14 days it will be well worth it. I didn’t know untill this afternoon. There are two of us going out of this company, a L/corporal and myself. There are others going from other companies I believe. I should not write anymore if I were you darling untill you hear from one as I expect I shall be gone by Wednesday.\nI think I’ll go and have a bath now dear as I’ve run out of news and if I leave the bath too long someone might pinch all the hot water.\nGoodnight darling. I’ll write as soon as I get a bit more information conserning my move.\nYours for ever,\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nPte B Shepherd\nB Coy\n13 Q R R\n℅ GPO\nLancaster\nLancs\n\nDarling,\nThank you dear for Mondays letter which I received this afternoon.\nFirst of all I write to say that my address is still here at Lancaster as I am not going into the guards yet. I did not know when I wrote that B company were only supplying the waiting men. Waiting men are the same as I was on the draft. I have everything packed and I and all my kit (also the L/corporal and kit) have to go to the station to make sure that no one konks out before they get to the station. Should anyone fall sick I or the L/C would have to take their place. I shall be going with another batch to the guards at some future date. I’ll give \"Bottle basher\" a bash on the bocks with a beer bottle if he isn’t careful. I expect you asked for it if he spanked you, anyway, and I have not sympathy whatsoever. \nYes, I did do some of the rowing dear but I’m not quite an expert yet but I did very well considering I’m an ametuer. They are lovely boats though, they’re skifs, very low in the water.\nYou know very well darling that am as excited at getting as much of home as we can whilst there is a chance. I have put in to get a summary of my credits down to see whether I shall be able to draw any out. If I can I will send it down to you dear what ever it is and you can get something. It is no use me getting anything is it, and you know that I shall like anything that you get.\nWe are swotting away at drill again for the Lancaster salute the soldier parade which is next Saturday so think of me on Saturday afternoon marching through the city. I hope its a nice day.\nI’m afraid I havent the time to finish answer all of your letter as it is bed time. I’ve been blancoing up and packing my kit which has taken up quite of the evening so I will write again as soon as I can.\nGoodnight darling I’m sorry if this letter is a bit scribbled but I am a bit rushed.\nGoodnight,\nYours for ever,\nBern\nxxxx\nxxxx\n"

You never said why it was written there but I suppose you were being invaided by Mr Warren. I will also endeavour to finish answering last Mondays which I didn’t in my last letter.\nWe havent had any thunderstorms as you have but I don’t think it has been hot enough for that.\nDarling, by \"getting married after the war\" I mean as soon as ever we can and not 2 or 3 years after. You know darn well what I meant, don’t you?\nGinty must think hes a bit of a champion fighter to take on dane - I shouldn’t fancy a fight with one of them myself.\nI didn’t mention the change of address dear to see whether you would notice it or not. It didn’t make much difference which address you put and I can’t realy understand why it was altered. If Jerry doesn’t know where the 13 QRR at Lancaster are by this time he must be a bit slow.\nAfter all the Guards talk I don’t think I’m going there so there is no worry about those awful peak caps. I shall be moving in a day or two but I havent the faintest idea where to. I and the L/cpl are having a kit inspection tomorrow in preparation for the move. Ofcourse it might be the Guards but I don’t think so.\nI’m not very good at rowing dear and thats why I’ve never taken you out but I’ll have a go when I’m on leave one day.\nI hope you are going on OK with cash posting machines. I bet they are pretty complicated. Can you play \"the Blue bells of Scotland\" on it yet?\nWe have had some excitement here tonight. The fire bugle sounded about an hour ago and we all had to dash onto the square. There was a fire out in some fields round here and every available truck took men to the fire. I am on fire picquet and was left behind as we only put fires out in the Barracks.\nThe salute of the soldier parade went off well on saturday and it was quite a nice day. I suprised myself (and we all did) upon the good show that the queens put up. It was real hot.\nIn the evening we went to a salute the soldiers Boxing, Army V the RAF. It ended up in a draw. There was one professional fight and the rest were amateur. There were 2 KOs. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The S.M. asked if anyone would like to get in for free by being \"usherettes\" so down went our names. We should have got there at 6:30 as the show started at 7:00 but got delayed and arrived at ten to seven. Anyway, we got in free and by that time everyone had come in so we had nothing to do. We selected ourselves two good 5/- seats and didn’t do to badly out of it.\nPlease excuse the odments of paper as the \"sally anne\" (thats the Salvation armies nich name) has run out of paper. They have plenty of envelopes all free but no paper.\nI must close now darling as it is bed time. I still love you dearest, as I could never love anyone else in the whole world and am longing for the day when we shall be to gether for ever. My leave seems years ago and I have a continious want to be home again. Even if I had the chance I couldn’t get home now that all leave has been stopped. I feel fed up to the teeth whenever I think of leave but I know it must be worse for you dearest, sitting there sometimes quite on your own. With other chaps all round there is little time to sit and brood over such things and only realy pierce right through me when I’m writing to you dearest.\nI must close now and get to bed before I strain my eyes. Goodnight darling.\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Bern\n"

You can see that I am a bit farther south than I was but not so near home as I had hoped and anticipated. I was quite mad when, on Saturday afternoon about 2:30, I passed right through Ilford station without even stopping. That is the second time that has happened. Remember dear? When I went to canvey Island from Plymouth. That seems to me years ago but it is only about 18 months.\nWe started out move from Lancaster on thursday Morning at 10 o’clock and travelled straight through to Bury St Edmunds. There are ten of us Queens and we arrived at Bury St Edmunds at 10:30pm where trucks to us to a camp under canvas. We stopped there untill Saturday morning when we came up by special train right up here and arrived here at 9pm. We are under canvas but who minds that in this weather? I’ll have to be carefull or I shall be having some sore and sun blistered skin. We are out in the sun all day with only our trousers on. Weather is certainly a bit different from Lancs where we slept in huts with overcoats on our beds.\nI can’t tell you what the town is like here as I havent been to it (its a 4d busride to Lewes. There is only a small village here with nothing in it at all.\nOne of my mates at Lancaster lives at Brighton which is quite near to here. I bet he wouldn’t mind being here. I have his address in my pocket.\nWe are not stopping here very long I don’t think, so I may get near enough to get home. I cannot think of anything else just now darling so I’m afraid I will have to close.\nYou know how much I love you dear and how I look forward to the day when we shall be together - for ever. \nGive my love to all at 59 and Goodnight darling.\nYours for ever,\nBern\nRoyal Norfolk Rgt\nNo1 Sub unit\n54 RHU\nConeyboro camp\nCooksbridge\nLewes Sussex\nxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxx\n"

Its more like no-mans land, miles from anywhere with an address, as I suppose you have observed, like an algebra seem gone wrong. We moved here today and have huts to sleep in instead of the canvas which makes it a bit more like home with beds to sleep on instead of a groundsheet.\nI’m not too far from home but afraid I can’t get there. I’m not too far away from my old RA home either. I’m getting a bit fed up of touring arround the country but I’m certainly seeing England. I’ll be gypy by the time I get the sack from this job. I’m just haveng a tour round the country.\nOfcourse darling I have not recieved any of your letter but I do hope that you and everyone else is quite alright at 59. I don’t suppose Eddie is able to get up as he used to but you can never tell what theese sargeants do.\nThe weather has broken up a bit to what it has been, hasn’t it dear? Maybe its a good job we are not under canvas if the weather has developed a bad temper. It tried to have a thunderstorm this afternoon but didn’t succeed.\nLast night we had no Pallias or Boulster as we had handed them in and had to sleep on the \"solid floor\" so the one I have tonight will feel like feathers.\nThere is nothing that I can write about just now darling in connect with the army or news as it is censored but one thing that cannot censor is my love for you darling which no one will ever stop no matter how they try. It is now getting dark dear and we have no lights so I’ll finish on this page.\nGoodnight darling I’ll write again as soon as I can. Yours for Ever,\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

I havent the the faintest idea of what I am going to write about aas no letters have reached us yet which is enough to make anyone browned off. I expect I shall get about 50 when they do arrive.\nWe have not done much since we’ve been here but I believe they have a toughening up program for us beginning tomorrow. I hope its not too much of a toughening up!\nThe weather is quite nice today dear but a strong breese is keeping it quite cool. Its not half the weather we had last week, I bet it was hot in the office up there wasn’t it? The tents which we were in then were not shaded and they were like bake houses although ofcourse it wasn’t stuffy as it would be in Bilbao.\nI went to the pictures last night at the Garrison Theatre. There is a show there practically every night. Its a big place and except for chairs instead of fixed seats it is exactly the same as an ordinary one. The stage is as big as that of the hippodrome. Last night I saw \"More the merrier\". Tomorrow is an ensa show. I didn’t go tonight as I have seen the film which is showing.\nI spent this afternoon in bed as there was nothing better to do and slept like a log until tea time (5:00).\nSome have gone to the nearest town, two or 4 for a walk, and the rest of us are content to either go to bed or write letters.\nI will close now my darling as I havent any thing else I can say. I have been sitting here for about ¼ of an hour trying to conjur up something to scribble but I’m afraid its impossible.\nI’m sorry its so short dearest but I would write 10 pages if it were at all possible. Goodnight darling I do hope you are alright, those letters should be here by Monday which you must have sent to Lancaster while I was roaming the country.\nAll my love darling and God bless you\nYours for always,\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxx\nXxxxxxxxxx\n"

I am an officers batman and just clean up the few things for him. We are living a very open air life and it is certainly a good job that it is summer and not when the snow is on the ground. The food is very reasonable infact dear it is sometimes better that the barracks. We get an issue of 7 cigarettes per day and chocolate and NAFFI parcels are just beginning to come through. Today we got 36 cigs each and certain toilet requires. I hope that you are all well at 59 as I have not recieved any letters yet but keep hoping for the best. They are sure to come eventually.

Its very nice here when the weather is fine but an absolute terror when it rains. Everything gets soaking wet as ofcourse we’ve nowhere to put things undercover.\nI hope darling that you are alright as I have not recieved any mail yet. Something must have happened to all my mail from Lancaster etc as quite a few chaps got their letters some days ago. I have given up hope of seeing any of that. I hope to get some proper writing paper tomorrow darling so that I can write a proper letter as theese are so small. They are a free issue by the NAAFI. One thing I’m saving plenty now and havent spent a franc since I landed (all our money was changed into French currency before we left. We got 200 francs the day before we sailed so we knew where we were coming to. (Not that it was much of a suprise to us). We shall be able to have a clean change of underclothing to day as our kit which we handed in back at Depot has arrived.\nIt is over 4 weeks since we changed our clothing so you can guess they are in a fine state, especially when you remember that we are living in mother earth. What wouldn’t I give for a nice hot bath, a change of clothing, and a nice feather bed. I’d sleep for 48 hrs.\nGoodnight darling paper is running short, I hope you are able to read this.

I also recieved one from mum posted the same day. I am sorry darling that I have not written before but I have no paper. I have Envelopes but no paper as active service ones have been issued. The pape which I brought over with me was in my big pack which got lost. Eventually they found it again but it had been opened and all my stock of writing gear and a pair of slippers was missing. Glad to say I am fine here looking after the officer. I have had 3 different officers since I’ve been here. The first, a canadian L/nt a joly fine chap who moved away 4 day after I got here. He gave me 100 francs when he left so it wasn’t too bad. The next was an English captain who used to give me all his cigarette rations. Now I’ve another L/nt whos quite a decent chap but he makes me run arround too much for my liking. I don’t suppose I shall run into Eddie darling as France is too big a place. Thank you dear for taking a letter round to mum. I didn’t know quite what to do realy.\nI hope you are not worrying about me dear as I’m quite OK. The food is very good too altho ofcourse its all tinned. Today we had Sausage meat & Tea for breakfast . Sardines and jam at miday and steak & kidney pudding & treacle pudding for dinner tonight. We get practically the same every day with little variation but with the apetite that I have it worries me very little. We have to cook ourselves. You certainly seem a queer family with everyone in bed. I do hope that they are better by the time this reaches you and I hope darling you are alright too now.\nI must close now darling as I’ve no more paper, I hope that you can read this. I’m sorry it is a bit of a mess darling but it is better than nothing. Goodnight darling I still love you dearest. Yours, Bern\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

I have recieved two more from mum and one from dad but apparently yours have been delayed. Mum says the letters are taking a week to get home and they are taking roughly the same time to get here. \nI’m afraid it is rather difficult to think of very much to write about as anything that I would like to write about is censored. Also I’ve been asleep this afternoon any my mind has not woke up yet. We do not get an inormas amount of sleep darling as we have to do look outs during the night and we do not bed down untill 11:30 at night and are up at half past four. Therefore we generaly manage some sleep during the day.\nIt was terrible here on Monday as it rained practicaly the whole of the day and night and we all got soaked through. Unfortunately our trench at that time was not made kind of weather and by morning was reduced to a mud hole. Also an extra officer turned up at the last moment and had to sleep in our trench. Therefore this trench which was barely big enough for two, had to accomodate 3. None of us got much sleep and were 3 parts drowned by morning. Since then we had an alteration to it so we are OK now. The weather has been a bit better since then but nothing like what one expects in June.\nI am batman now to another officer as the other one as gone away. This chap is alot better than the last one who I never liked very much. No one in this platoon thought very much of him.\nEverything is going fine here darling with nothing much to report. This countryside is exactly the same as that of England untill one gets to a village which are nothing like the clean little villages of Britain. Ofcourse they have been smashed about alot which makes them look ten times worse but taking that into consideration the places are dirty and ugly and roads like cart tracks.\nWe were very please on Sunday when we were marched to a farm about 4 miles away and had a shower which we all neaded badly. It was well over 4 weeks since I had had a bath and a change of underclothing and it was glorious. Hot water too.\nI cannot think of any more news just now darling I hope that all of 59 are alright and am longing to see them all again.\nNomatter how far we are apart darling you know that I love you more than anything in the whole world and am just as near to you at heart than I was while on those 3 weeks leave which I shall never forget.\nGoodnight darling I must close to catch the post.\nAll my love\nYours for Ever\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

I have received no more letters from you dear since the first one, although I know you must have written dozens. From now on I am going to number my letters so that you can tell whether or not you are recieving them all. I expect I have written about ½ a dozen up to now. I’m glad to be able to say I’m fine here and having quite a cushy time. The weather being the only bugbare. Luckily this afternoon is quite nice but untill dinner time it kept raining at intervals. Yesterday we had a heavy hail storm and everywhere was absolutely soaked. We kept dry, though, in our covered trench.\nIf possible I’m going to boil up some potatoes (new) for dinner tonight and make a realy good feed of it. A notice came round yesterday stating that digging of potatoes will cease. This we assume is so that the French don’t run short later on. There are fields full not far away. Our biscuit ration seems to have got shorter that it used to be. We only get one packet per day (that is the alloted amount laid down by the army) but I could easily eat that lot for breakfast. \nBy evening when the hot meal comes up one is feeling rather peckish. Except for that, the food is very good. It would be grand to taste a bit of bread and are expecting some up some time. Just before we left England we were getting white bread, so it was a knock down when we got biscuits.\nI cannot think of anything else to write just now darling as there is precious little to write about but I’ll write as frequent as I can even though it is only two lines to let you know I’m OK. Please don’t expect them too often and worry when you don’t get one every 2 or 3 days as the mail might get lost or held up. Goodnight my darling, I am always thinking of you every minute of the day.\nYours for ever,\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nPte B Shepherd\nA Coy \n1st Btn Royal Norfolks\nB.W.E.F.\n\nMy Darling,\nThank you dear for Monday the 26ths letter which I recieved on Monday. Appearantly you had not got any more of my letters then but I expect they have turned up by now.\nDennis made up his mind at last then. Was it a sudden insparation or was it the date settled some time ago? I would definately not live at home when we get married darling I would see to that, as things never seem to turn out right if one does. It certainly will be fun dear and I’ll do all I can to make you happy.\nI have seen \"Gone With the Wind\" dear. Its been since I was in the army and I am sure that I wrote and told you but I expect you have forgotten. I should certainly enjoy seeing it again, infact I could wish for hardly anything better than to take you to the Super or Regal tonight even if the film was Tom mixin cement or \"Blackout\" in Technicolour.\nI have another new officer now, this is the 5th since I came out here and a very nice chap too. Its very strange coinsidence as he took me on Guard mounting at Bowerham barracks just before I left. I was in the Queens and he was in the Berkshires and I finish up as batman to him in the Norfolks. My what a war!\nFor a change the weather has been quite nice today except for a rather sharp breeze so now when one goes anywhere we walk on solid ground instead of a sea of mud and we nolonger have to abandon trench and bale out.\nGlad to say the biscuit situation now has been righted and we get our full supply again. We made a complaint to the officer who looked into the matter and discovered that some were getting too many and we were going short. The scales have now been balanced and although the going is hard we have enough to eat. Why they are mixed with cement I don’t know. Maybe the flour situation is more critical than we imagine.\nWould it be possible for you to send me a pencil please darling as they are impossible to get here and the one I have is barely an inch long. It likes to hide in all manner of small corners and plays hide and seek with me for half an hour whenever I go to write a letter or get interupted in the middle of one which is bery often. (That is the fault of being an important person)\nI cannot think of any more to scribble just now so I will close darling but remember dear I am always thinking of you and shall be home again intime for christmas.\nGoodnight darling remember me to 59\nYours for ever,\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nPte B Shepherd\nA Coy \n1st Bat Royal Norfolks\nBLA\n\nMy Darling,\nPlease do not blame the PO for not recieving any letters from me lately darling as I’m afraid I must admit that I have not sent any. You see dear we have been rather busy just lately but luckily I am quite well and safe but have had no time to write. I sent you a card which I hope you got OK but could not send any more because no more cards have been issued.\nI have been receiving your letters quite regularly dearest, thank you very much and also the parcel which I got yesterday morning. The mail is comming in about 4 or 5 days so one cannot grumble. I’m afraid I can only answer one of your letters (24th which I got today) as I am writing this in the so called Officers Mess, a back of a lorry actually, and the rest of your letters are back in the tent.\nI am glad you got to Canvey without any trouble on Sunday. I suppose they are not so strict on the ban now that the 2nd front is well on the way. \nI have not seen Burnie in his uniform but I expect he looks pretty smart with his stripes and wings up. Burnie certainly is the best of the Bucks boys and you’d have to search hard to find another chap like him. Please don’t let your imagination run away with you dear I know how good I am.\nI’m sorry but I forgot to thank you for the parcel dear which was grand. I was right out of tooth paste so that came very exceptable. Some chap sat on my pack and made the tube of paste in it rather unusable. My shaving soap is getting short too. You can see how short I was of paper by what I am using now.\nI had some German writing paper and envelopes but they got wet and crushed. I could have had tons of German Kit during the past few weeks but it is as much as I can do to carry what I have. You see dear I am a wireless operator and I have to carry a set arround with me which is pretty hefty. I did not tell you this before as I tried with the help of the batman stuff to create the impression that I had a jammy static position miles behind the line and the wireless might have shattered the impression. By your letters I don’t think it quite worked. As you know I tried my best to keep away from signalling and untill I got over here I was successful. Anyway, they must have had it marked down in my records as I have never told them since I left the RA and a few days after I landed, word was sent down to collect a W/S. Ofcourse they are nothing like the big RA sets - the batteries and equipment are in a satchel which is slung over ones shoulder and the set itself is strapped onto the chest with the ariel sticking up in the air. All the Batman are signallers. At one place we captured some weeks ago we found a big german W/S in a dugout where we stopped for the night. I got on the job and much to my suprise after a bit of tinerking around I got it going. We had the BBC on it. We could not bring it with us as it was too big. The set was two halves and I could just lift up one half off the ground on my own, so you can imagine the weight of it. I bet it was worth 3 or 400 quit. I don’t think I shall be able to finish this letter tonight as it is getting dark and anyway the post has gone. We have been getting the officers (and ourselves) supper which consisted of steak and chips and it cut the evening up. Last night we had fried egg, chips & beans. We are getting tons of food here dear and always have except for the time when the biscuits were short which was soon altered. I’m afraid its Saturday night now darling although Saturday doesn’t mean the same here as it does at home. Saturday, Sunday, and Monday are all alike here. Tonight for supper we have Steak & chips followed by biscuits, dairy butter, and cream cheese, both straight from the farm. Also tea made with proper tea, milk and sugar, a thing which I have not yet had since we landed. We always have \"Comps tea\", a mixture of tea, dried milk and sugar which doesn’t usually come up to the standard of English tea. We have some eggs for tomorrow night.\nI have your letters here now darling so I shall indevour to answer them. I shall not answer them all separately as that would take me untill tomorrow morning doing so many. Thank you darling.\nNo dear I’m afraid I cannot say where I am as that would be giving the same away. If Jerry knew where I was he’d be sending all his doodle bugs here mass bombing. No dear I have recieved no 5/- G.O. I’m afraid. In any case never send any money darling as it is absolutely useless. I can’t change it. We were paid 100 francs when we came out here (10/-) and I’ve had two pays since then of 200 francs each. It is impossible to pay us out regularly each week and in any case we cannot spend it ¾ of the time. I’ll have some in credit when I come back but I’m warning you I’m going to get \"lit up\" on some of that!\nI’m sorry dear if mum recieved more letters from me than you dear but I can assure you that I have written the same number to each of you. Now you know darling.\nI hope to be out of the army next june darling and if so your date is mine. It gives me a thrill to think of it.\nI will close now darling. Goodnight dearest, you are always in my thought\nYours for Ever, Bern.\n"

I’m sorry I have not written as many as I should like to but I have not had the time. Will you please thank Colin for what he wrote, I do hope he did not upset your nib too much.\nI’m sorry that Will has had to go into the army. Doris I think is crazy to wish he had gone at the beginning so that he’ll be out first. By the time he has done his training we hope that this lot will be almost if not quite finished and good luck to him if he can miss this. Its certainly no picnic. I think the army life will do Will good as he hasn’t looked well for a long time. I think hes looked like that ever since he got married but don’t say anything.\nI’m glad you like my selection of wireless sets as I choose Mums. I’m pretty certain she wouldn’t part with that unless she decided she’d get a television which wouldn’t suprise me in the leasy. You can bet I get a nice one though darling.\nI have no cause to grumble about the mail as it now comes pretty regularly. It was at the beginning of the campaign that it was a bit shaky but ofcourse that can be well understood. It is very well for people to pull things to pieces in the mirror but many don’t realise the masive organisation that it takes for theese sort of things, especially when millions of lorrys, tanks, ammo, men, and tons of food have to be shipped here to keep us going. You should have seen the french coast when we landed to realise it, its a scene I shall not forget.\n2/- seems alot for plates I should think dear but I’m not much of a judge darling I shall have to leave all that sort of thing to you.\nIt is realy glorious here today dear and I hope it is the same at home. It usually is I believe.\nI hope hope the flying bombs have a little less troublesome than they have been. Although no one has said much about them I know that you are getting quite a few and that they are very nerve wrecking as well as dangerious. I’ve seen two of them myself going over here.\nI have just found another of your letters dear dated the 2nd. I’m sorry the postman didn’t bring your longed for letter dear on Wed the 23, I expect you were releaved when my Fridays letter came on the 4th.\nSorry to hear Veras brother was wounded but good luck to him if it was only what we call a slight blity one. Just bad enough to return home to England.\nGive my love to Miss Edney will you, please dear (ho its Mrs now isn’t) and please congratulate her for me. Yes, she is a very nice girl dear I believe it shook her when I took you out but please don’t tell her I said so.\nHow in the earth do you know what sort of holidays I like darling? As a matter of fact I do like what you call riotous holidays with plenty of dash in then but you should know that by now darling. I’m like an army quartermaster, gives you whatever you want.\nI cannot think of any news that I am able to write about so I must apply the break before the engine ceases up for want of petrol.\nI do hope you are not worrying about me darling as god is guarding me. I am now fully confident of comming out of this without a scratch as a mirical saved me the other day. I had as near a thing as anyone would like to have but didn’t even get a bruise.\nI must now close and drop mum a line so goodnight dear and god bless you.\nYours for Ever\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nPte B Shepherd\nA Coy \n1st Bat Royal\nNorfolk Regt\nBLA\n\nMy Darling,\nThank you very much for your letters dear and also for the cigarettes which I recieved last week. I now have plenty of cigarettes as I recieved 200 from dad the day after yours, also we’ve had NAFFI packs up, as many cigs as you would like to buy and today a Church of Scotland canteen, the first canteen we’ve seen since we landed. I havent started on the 400 cigarettes yet as the issue has kept me going and thats not because I’ve been smoking lightly. Yes the week before I only had 7 per day. Still they will come in useful again when we only get our bare ration. At the moment one cannot give cigarettes away and everyone is very generious. If they pull out cigs they offer them all round. I’ve never seen anything like it before since I joined the army.\nI don’t think I have told you when I came out here, have I dear? I came out on D+2 so I missed the brunt of the beginning. From what the boys tell me of the landing I’m glad I was late for the party.\nI had a letter from Claude the other day and he fairly chewed my head off because I don’t say where I am in my letters. I think he believes I’m in the Naffi or ensa show! I hope you understand darling that I cannot say where I am. The reason is that if jerry knows that the norfolks are in a certain place he immediately knows how many men and their armement and can act accordingly. True enough, the germans know where the British line is but they don’t know (we hope) who occupy them. I can’t even say whether I’m in action or not and writing is limited to things like the weather. I can see that you are searching the papers OK, of course they are old attacks which come in the paper but at least they will let you know where we have been.\nOur badge is Britiania darling and I am in the Royal Norfolk Rgt which is I believe the only one.\nWe get alot more variaty in food now as we get what is called ‘fresh ration’. Actually fresh ration consists mostly of dried and de hidreted food which is very nice when cooked up and is a great change from the tins that we have lived on ever since we came out. You can bet that the sight of some of the tinned stuff was sufficient after having it for two months. We also get bread now instead of biscuits which makes things alot better.\nWe have had four lots of beer since landing. The other night we had quite a ‘do’. They rigged up some side shows - free with cigarettes for prizes, and we got four tins of beer (or rather Lager) each and some sandwiches. 8 platoon (thats my platoon) put on a show which, considering that it was all fixed up in one afternoon, was jolly good. That evening was the best I’ve had over here.\nPlease tell me if you get any close shaves arround you dear as I’ll only worry if I think you wouldn’t tell me. Although noones ever told me, I have known that you’ve been getting theese bugs bombs over for some time now but havent said much as you’ve never spoken about them. I’m not the only chap who lives arround those parts even in the norfolks. I’m glad that you visit the shelter now darling. I have very great faith in trenches now. I’m sorry that Glady caught a packet the other week, I do hope she has not lost too much.\nI would rather you did not send any parcels darling as its impossible to carry any surplus kit, not only is it a hinderance but it all makes things heavier which we try to cut down as much as possible. If I want anything darling I can usualy manage to find it somewhere arround france.\nNow you need not feel mean anymore darling as I don’t want anything except to get this thing finished and come home to you dear.\nI hope that everyone at 59 are quite alright and well. I have nothing more to say now darling so I will close. Bye bye darling all my love\nYour for Ever,\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

I waited for a chap who was at the rest camp to return as I asked him to try and get a card of some kind but he didn’t get one, still never mind.\nI’m sorry I have not written for about a week but I always gets dark by the time I’ve finished work and we are not issued with electricity nowadays.\nI have recieved Nos 14 and 16 letters but appearantly No 15 has lost its way.\nSo you get soaked on Saturday night (the 18th) did you - That will teach you to go out in thin frocks. I hope it wasn’t that one which shrinks at the sight of water.\nYes dear I remember Xmas 41. I don’t know what you imagine happened dear but I certainly wouldn’t call that my \"murkey past\" what ever that means. You put passed but presume you mean PAST. Poor old Burnie always seemed to get the blame for anythink which happened.\nIt seems so strange to read a letter from you dear written in black ink instead of the usual purple also written with an ordinary pen.\nI saw \"For whom the Bells Toll\" at Lancaster months ago, I believe. It was about nurses wasn’t it? If that is the film, I enjoyed it although I didn’t think it worth the praise that it was given. Tell tim to send the bills over for the Pictures, they must be in Francs & cents or I wont accept them. Those £.S.D. get me muddled!\nBy the way you speak in your letter one would think you were a terrible writer. Its usually a jolly sight better than the letters I send you.\nThe weather is terrible today. Its almost tea time now and its been raining ever since I got up at 6:15 this morning. It looks a lot brighter now so maybe it will clear up later on. I’m in a barn so it doesn’t worry me a great deal.\nI had a letter from Claude yesterday type written during his firms time and as I knew about the damage, gave me a detailed description of it. Its certainly made a bit of a mess hasn’t it? There wont be much of our portion of road left between the lane and Woodlands, I shouldn’t think.\nI must close now darling and go and set tea so\nByy Bye dearest\nYours for Ever\nBern\n"

I have been put on a Signal course which lasts all day and ofcourse I’ve had my hands full at night time doing what I should do during the day. With no word of a lie I’ve been going until dark then I’ve had to pack up. Anyway, hang it all tonight! All I’m doing tonight is supper.\nI’ve quite a few of your letters here which I dug up out of every pocket on my tunics so I’ll start. I’ve sorted out the answered from the unanswered ones.\nI recieved your cigarettes on Wednesday dear thank you so much, I’ve never yet been short of cigarettes thanks to you darling since I’ve been over here. Untill just before the cigarettes began to arrive I had officers who didn’t smoke and consequently had double ration, then for a few weeks I was short until the first batch of cigs arrived and I have had enough ever since. I was beginning to run a bit low when yours arrived this week, together with another packet which came from mum.\nI hope Colins arm is better again now. He certainly knows how to smash himself arround doesn’t he. Hes getting himself toughened up incase he gets in a rough house anytime.\nHave you still got the cat or has it decided to roam again. You must teach Ginty to respect it.\nThe postman must have had a job with that letter which was returned after traveling England. I expect there are (or were) thousands more the same.\nHave you bought another coat dear or are you still waiting for me to say the colour? I don’t realy know what colour I should like and also depends apon what frocks you have to go with it, I don’t think I should like black although it looks very nice on some people. Does black suit you dear? I can’t remember whether it does or not.\nKeep that 5/- darling from Bucks and either buy something with it or else put it asside and wait untill you get some more POs from Bucks - save them instead of sending them to me, and get something for our home.\nI’ve very glad to hear that the flying bombs don’t trouble you now darling. From Claudes report it seems that our house got it rather badly but that is the last thing I think. I hope you are getting the Blackout lifted now and it will certainly make a great difference to the place anyway. I wish I were over there to enjoy it with you darling.\nI have had quite a bit of fruit over here dearest but it is nothing like the English stuff. It is grown mostly for cider and wines and none of them touch ours for eating.\nThe writing paper which you sent me dear I’m afraid got mucked up when moving one day - its awkward stuff to keep. Envelopes are the worst as if you get caught in the rain the slightest bit of moisture seals them all up.\nI hope you do not worry about me now dear as I’m quite safe and fit as a fiddle. I’m getting good food and for about a month now I’ve been living better than many people in Brittian, I bet.\nI only hope this lot is over before the actual winter sets in though it wouldn’t be too bad just here. I think we are on the eve of the finish though.\nIt will be grand to get home again and live in a real house and be able to take out usual little strolls. Whenever I think of it I feel a thrill inside of me - it seems years since I saw you last darling but one day I’ll be back again and have a little home of our own with out having to worry about going back off leave. It is now beginning to get dark and I am guessing more or less where I am writing so I must clost. I wish I could carry on all night but I can’t so goodnight darling and rap yourself in cotton wool, you wont have to wait much longer darling. Get that Christmas dinner cooking.\nYours till the birds fail to sing,\nBern\nP.S. I can’t read it its too dark. Bern\n"

Thank you dearest, for your letters which have been coming pretty regular considering.\nGlad to say I’m still kicking arround OK and feeling fine. The weather is a bit naughty of late, I expect it is the same over there dear. It rains one minute and shines the next so we keep rushing out blankits, overcoats, etc in and out to dry in accordance with the weather.\nThank you darling for the birthday card and please thank Tim for his please. I spent the 24th down a trench and as a birthday present it poured with rain practicaly the whole night and owing to inadiquet cover everyone was soaked. The trench I am in now is water proof so it may rain (except when I’m in watch). It has straw on the bottom and up the sides so its pretty comfortable. It gets pretty cold of a night time now so one has to look after theese holes. I wish I could tell you where I am now but that is impossible I’m afraid darling. We have had a roaring reception here and they treated us like heros.\nHave you moved to the minories yet? Have you any idea as to why they should suddenly move. It seems funny after being at Bilbao so long - I suppose they are staying there after the war and Bilbao was rather expensive.\nI’m afraid seeing a few Royal Norfolks doesn’t cut any ice darling as they have more than one Battalion and there are bound to be some in England.\nI cannot think of any more news darling that I am allowed to put in. You know darling I love and kiss you and how I look forward to the day when you can greet me coming home on disembarkation leave. The number of times I think of you during the day are uncountable and the castles I build in the air which will one day be true.\nGive my love to all at home (59) and God bless you dear.\nYours for always, Bern\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\n\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nPte B Shepherd\nA Coy \n1st Bat Royal Norfolk\nBLA\n\nDarling Kath,\nI expect you will be surprised dear to get a letter from me so soon after the last one which I wrote two days ago but I have a little more time to myself just now. I do not know how long it will last but you can be sure it will not be for long.\nLast night I recieved quite a fan mail as they have been held up for a few days which I can quite understand knowing the circumstances. I also recieved 200 players from Dad.\nThank you for all your letters darling I have quite a stack of them here which I will try and answer if need be.\nI am glad mum was able to get Tim and yourself some dinner while your mother was away. It would have been late if you had cooked yourself, getting home about 6:30. Are they altering the time that you knock off now that it gets dark earlier as they have done in previous years?\nI hope Rene turned up alright after all. I hate waiting about for anyone for an hour or so and then they don’t turn up.\nI didn’t say I didn’t like black darling infact a black + white coat or frock looks very nice indeed. All I asked was uf black suited you but now I come to think of it I believe it does.\nDad told me about what he calls a \"friendly argument\" he had with you dear I should have liked to have heard it, it may have proved very amusing. I bet he was pulling your leg half the time!\nI hope that your boil has by this time dispersed darling and hope that you don’t get a reoccurance of them especialy where you got that one.\nI forgot to mention that I also recieved yesterday the two Bucks Bulletins which you sent. Thank you very much, they are very interesting.\nAlthough I started this letter yesterday the 4th, I’m afraid I didn’t finish it mainly due to the fact that the trench was very comfortable. I fell asleep half way through it. We do quite a bit of watch during the night and broken sleep soon tires one.\nFor dinner or rather lunch today our ration was Biscuits, cheese, + jam, so we mucked in and managed to secure and cook pork, potatoes, and cabbage.\nIts a grand day here today - quite a change from what it has been. Its not very hot but the sun has been shining the whole time and we’ve had no rain.\nI am afraid I have come to the end of writing as I cannot think of anything to write about darling. I only wish that this lot was over so that I could come home to you. What a day it will be when I do get home and no more have to long and wish that I was with you dear. Till then we can only think of the past and imagine the future.\nGoodnight, love, I am thinking of you always.\nYours,\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

We’ve been rather busy lately and I have been unable to write but glad to say I am quite well and safe which is the main thing.\nI’m sorry I have not put the Nos on my letters just lately darling but I’ve forgotten the number. I put the dates on when I know them but its of little use guessing them.\nIt would have been a good idea for me to have got in the medical corps. Eddie seems to be doing well living in houses. He is somewhere round about where I am, though the chances of meeting him are pretty slight.\nWe havent been having a very jammy time lately and its been raining practically the whole time so you can imagine the state we were in. At times I’ve been up to my thighs in mud and slosh and covered in mud from head to good. I’m OK now, though, as we’ve been issued with new Battledresses - boots & gaters. I feel like a rookie. Talking of rookies, I wonder how Claude feels with his first week in the army? According to dad he was non too keen on going but I expect he will soon get used to it. I hope that all the fighting has finished before he is trained. This life is no good at all. I like the bit about kissing girls - I havent had the chance yet and if I had the chance darling you should know me by this time.\nYou’re certainly a fine one to meet anyone off a train, I must say! I expect you got in that cafe and started talking and forgot the time. I bet Rene was in a bit of a state.\nI am sorry to hear that your black coat has had to be held up untill some future date. As far as I can remember I’ve never lost any money (except odd coppers). Practically every night I would sprawl it all over the bedroom floor when putting on my trousers under the bed but since I’ve been in the army I always take it out first.\nAnyone who says the war will be over before Christmas is talking through his hat. He should have a go at it and find out. There is the difference of chalk and cheese between this and the last war.\nTheres one thing we are all cut up about. We keep bashing away out here and living in idea conditions and F. M. Monty kindly says we can have 48 hrs leave every 6 months! In 1940 when men and material were rock bottom they had leave to blity. They must be frightened we’ll get stale or something! Still, they must give us something to moan about or else we’ll never go on.\nI will close now, I must write to mum darling. Its a good job dear that you cannot post yourself here as I would only send you back on the next post. It is I darling that would post myself if anyone could. I am often wondering dearest, what it will be like when I come home again - I shall never forget my first leave and this will be 1000 times greater than that. I don’t want to come home untill this is finished darling as it would only mean coming back again or going out East which would be very hard. I will close now darling longing to be able to see you more than anything in the world.\nGoodnight darling. Tell Eddie to keep looking for me.\nYours for ever,\nBern\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\n"

We’ve been issued with woolen underwear now which will help, also gloves.\nTim has better go careful knocking people down and picking on a woman of all people. Still, you see what I can do when I get my Rolls Royce.\nNo darling you neadn’t be alarmed, I shan’t come back like some hardened criminal just released from dartmoor. I don’t think I’ve altered very much from theese experiences but I’ll let you judge that when I get home. Bye the way, have you yet decided what we’re having for Christmas?\nThere was not much which needed answering in your letters dear and I’ve almost come to a sticky end so if its a load of junk darling please forgive me. It is amazing how you find so much to talk about as my letters are not very helpful.\nTheres just one thing, its about me telling mum (or rather so you say) more than I tell you dear. If it is the case I’m sure I don’t mean it but what I am at is this :- I could easily write practicaly the same so both of you but if I left something out of one I would automatically leave it out of the other and when you got together and compared them, as I expect you do, there would be nothing to it.\nTherefore dear I always stick one away in an envelope before starting the next.\nSometimes I write yours dear and have not time for mums and by the time I do write hers something else has turned up. Dad wrote and said the other day \"You told Kath that you went on a signal course but you said nothing to us\" which makes me think that its 6 of one and half a dozen of the other. Never mind darling it will all come out in the Rinso.\nI had a letter from Claude yesterday and he certianly isn’t very keen on it, even the bayonet they have issued isn’t long enough! He’ll get used to it before long. \nI cannot think of a thing to write about darling and mail is just going in so I will close. See you christmas darling. How grand it will be when I do get home eventualy darling and every day I think about it more & more. I often imagine what you are doing dearest, during the day \nGive my love to everyone at 59, Goodnight darling.\nYours For Ever,\nBern\nxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxx\n"

I was going to write yesterday but was too busy and this afternoon I was busy preparing a meal for tonight (High tea 7:00) so am writing it now by a home made oil lamp.\nI sent you a parcel today dear which I hope you recieve alright. I am afraid you will have to pay duty but that should not be much. I’m afraid it will be a little early for Christmas but I could not keep it incase we should and I could not carry it.\nI have been to Brussels. I left here last Wed, stopped at the division club the night, arrived at Brussels 1 o’clock Thursday, and came back to the club Saturday night. Back to this dump on Sunday, I had a grand time there, we slept \n(it is now Saturday afternoon and I have run out of ink) to continue.\nin a hotel with two sharing one room, a lovely spring bed, hot + cold water, and a bath room opposite. They gave us a map of Brussels with all canteens, hotels, theatres, cinimas, etc marked which was very handy. Ofcourse 48 hrs was not long enough to be able to see much of Brussels and we barely saw any more that the main street. We went to an Ensa show at one of the theatres and also a cinima. We had to pay at the cinima as it was a civy place but was, like others, English with interputation written underneath for the Belgiums.\nTrust you to smash Margarets machine so that even the mech can’t figure it out!\nI have neither seen nor heard anything about the L/cpl who is supposed to give me a message from Eddie but appearantly Eddie isn’t far away to be able to contact some of our chaps. I hope it is the right Batalion and the right Shepherd that this L/cpl is taking the note to. Maybe if you gave me his address it might give me an idea as to his whereabouts. Ofcourse I’d recognise him, who wouldn’t!\nI have not recieved the marcel which you speak of darling but thank you for sending it, I expect it will turn up soon.\nWhen I asked \"What are we having for Christmas\" darling I referred to the dinner which we shall have on Christmas day when I’m on leave (I don’t think). It was my fault darling I didn’t make myself clear.\nI knew that chap who got the VC (Cpl Bates). We had a collection for him. I didn’t know the officer, though I expect I should know him by sight. Many of times we have been in the paper but the R Norfolks has not been put in. It has described in full out attacks and what happened which is very interesting to us. Of course they have painted the picture a bit by putting things like \"crack D day infantry div\" etc.\nI didn’t send you any perfume dear as I thought you would apreciate something else just as much which would last. I would have got you a fountain pen if I had known you wanted one darling I bought 2, one I sent to dad, and the other I kept myself.\nThe news is quite good now isn’t dearest, except for theese new rockets (V2) which he is using on England. Please tell me dear if you get any arround your way. Its a pity that the bases are not static like doodle bugs.\nI have exhausted all my news dearest, so must close. Keep your chin up dear lets hope it wont be long before I am back again when we can make up for this separation. Goodnight my darling, if love turns one catchy, I’m the craziest man in the world.\nYours for Ever\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx\nXxxxxxxxxx\n"

I have not much time now dear so this may only be short. I glad to say dear I’m still as well as ever and am longing for the day when I can come back to you again.\nI wrote and told you about going to Brussels dear didn’t I? Only dad said you knew nothing about when you were round. I told them at home first I know because I wrote to you the day before I knew I was going and did not have time to write again untill I came back. Sorry dearest.\nOfcourse I still have my ring dear it never leaves my finger. I wouldn’t give that to be in England even.\nThank you very much for the parcel darling it was grand. Will you please thank mum for the cake - you can bet it did not last long. We have all had parcels in Platoon HQ so you can bet quite a variety of cakes etc. Mr Rourke (our officer) had a hugh parcel weighing quite a few pounds according to the label, it contained writing paper, envelopes, toothpaste, blades, & mags. Those papers etc must have been made with iron. He had a cake, a pudding, and a stack of tinned stuff. We are feeding ourselves well now and we are not living in trenches either. We’ve quite a nice house fully furnished and no one seems to call for the rent. I’m no expert at cooking but between us we manage to get along alright. One of the boys is a ‘handy man’ (ofcourse hes married) and he does such things as pastry etc. Sometimes we have the cookhouse meal at dinnertime and then cook up a \"gentlemans dinner\" in the evening. The worst of it is that the house we occupy at the moment doesn’t contain a very good oven, so we have to use someone elses.\nI still have heard nothing of that L/cpl darling who is supposed to have seen me for Eddie. Either hes having a game or else got the wrong Shepherd which I dout as a chap wouldn’t sent a message to Eddie if he didn’t know him.\nThere is nothing darling for you to buy me for christmas. I have every thing I need except you darling and I wouldn’t allow you to come out here for one moment. If you should send me a parcel anytime such as you sent last week please don’t put chocolate in darling as it is your ration, we get chocolate up quite frequently and in any case I can always do without.\nThe weather has not been very kind lately but we have had no snow which is one blessing. It keeps raining every so often which makes the trenches like mud baths.\nI am afraid I have no news for you dear so I shall have to close. I think I will try and get some sleep in now as we get very little during the night.\nGoodnight darling (I say goodnight tho’ its afternoon) I am always thinking of you - May we be together again very soon darling.\nYour Loving Son Bern\n"

We have been having a few more dos lately but ofcourse I have come out alright as per usual.\nI’m glad you recieved the parcel darling I was afraid that someone might take a fancy to it before it got home as many parcels have been lost on their way home. That is why I registered it. I got those at Brussels myself. The Bon Marche there is like a Gamages or Selfridges but even bigger and very up to date. One walks arround there just like Woolworths, its packed with soldiers who but all sorts of things and no-one thinks anything of buying ladies clothes. I wouldn’t buy them in England but that was Belgium.\nI should say Burnie is lucky but I shouldn’t fancy this chance of going to Burma.\nThere is one thing which I nearly forgot to ask you dear how much did you have to pay on the parcel that I sent. I hope it wasn’t too much, you never said.\nThis letter looks as though it is going to be short as I’ve nothing to write about. I have not seen anything of that L/cpl who has seen Eddie. I don’t think he knows me.\nI must close now darling as I cannot dig up anything to write about. You know how much I love you dear and how I’m looking for the day when I come home again. Countless times recall the happy times that we have spent together. Maybe it wont be long before those glorious days are back again.\nGive my love to everyone at your home, goodnight darling.\nYours for Ever\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx\n"

Please forgive me if it is so dear.\nI have not seen that L/cpl dear nor given any message to say that I would go and see Eddie, therefore I presume that he has contacted the wrong Shepherd. When Rene writes again tell her to write Eddie that I’m in A coy of the 1st Btn. That should clear the matter up as I’m the only one in A company.\nI shall never forget the 25th March 44 dear and you bet its an important day in my life darling.\nDon’t get worried over what an officer says on the radio about the Infantry. I must admit that its a bit thick at times but other times its pretty easy. We are living in the height of Luxuary now.\nI expect it is a problem to buy presents for Christmas isn’t it darling? You should take a trip to Brussels, and get anything you want.\nI’ve been in the ‘wars’ lately. I jumped off a truck with a wireless set on my chest. As I jumped the set shot up and caught my upper lip and made a nasty gash. Its swelled up like a balloon and is ackward for eating. Its healing up a bit now. Also I have a bit of a chill on me which doesn’t make me feel too great.\nI do realize how luck I am to have a Mother and Father dear it is rotten for your mother, I’ve often thought of that before. It was a good job that she did not have all boys as mine did else she would have been pretty lonely with everyone in the Forces.\nYes darling I have been receiving Bucks Bullitins, I’m sorry I have not acknowledged them; they are very interesting. Half the platoon Reads them.\nI will close now dear write a note to mum and then crawl in to bed.\nGoodnight darling you’l never know my love for you, its deaper that the pasific oceon. If only I could express myself as well as you do dear but then I can’t write love letters, even with 2 ½ years practise. All my deapest Love dear\nJust yours,\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx\n"

You must realise that I’m a batman. I don’t just clean up my own kit and finish, I have a stack more to do than anyone else, a batmans job in action is no picnic as I do just as much as everyone else as well as looking after the officer. I often have to rush letters and get a bit muddled and I’m sorry I finished your letter off wrongly. I do try and write as often as possible but it gets dark very early and the hurricane lamp we have does not give a very good light. We are in quite a decent house now but not so comfortable as the last one which was furnished lovely and utensils etc were at our finger tips. We have a fire in it which is one eccentual and a nice big celar which is the most important.\nSince I have been out here I have not seen an open fire such as we always have in England. They all have theese combustion stoves which give out a good heat but do not look cheerful as the other fires do.\nI’d like to know what all theese dozens of questions are which you supposed to ask me darling as I always have your letters in front of me whenever I write. I never avoid answering them dear as you seem to think. You know I wouldn’t want to keep anything from you don’t you dear?\nI’m glad Mrs Fountain is alright dear. From what I’ve seen of girls its a good job they can’t choose their childrens sex else women would be a trifle short by this time.\nI recieved the cake in one piece thank you dear. If it had been smashed up I would have said but being OK I didn’t.\nI’ve still heard nothing of the ghost L/cpl.\nIt shan’t put England on my letters dear as all letters go to England from here. If I send a letter to another person in the BLA it still goes to England first so I’ve been told. Remember this is the A.P.O. out here not the G.P.O.\nMr Rourke, our officer, has been awarded the M.C. for one of the jobs we did. The action was splashed about in the papers but did not give any names so you wouldn’t know who it was. I sewed it on this morning, its white with a blue centre.\nI cannot think of any more news just now so will put down the reciever and dial Hampton Road.\nBelieve me dearest, I am always thinking of you and praying that I shall be home again for good.\nBye Bye sweet,\nFrom Yours,\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

The reason for getting them all together is because I am temporarly away from A coy and am at HQ helping the sigs as I’m a reserve signaller.\nI am sorry I have not written lately but it is very ackward here. We are working during the day and at night we have no light. I am free for a while not but goodness knows how long for dear. Johnie Leach is here also (He lives in Cantley gdns I think it is). Also another from A and I’ve made pals with some of the sig platoon so I’m quite settled. I shall be spending Christmas at HQ, altho I would sooner spent it in my own platoon no matter where they are. I helped unload the NAAFI christmas supplies - it contained beer, red wine, burgundy, brandy, tinned turkey, xmas pudding, oranges, apples, pears, cigarettes, cigars, and sweets. That is additional to what the army supply. I think we get pork for xmas.\nI cannot give you any details of my leave darling except that I should be home between middle and end of January. In A coy all the D day & D1 names were put in a hat and drawn. I came out 20th so it depends apon how quickly the chaps go on leave. Its pretty frequent I believe. I would rather have my operation before I get married darling and I am going to try and get it done while I am still in blighty after comming back off leave. It all depend apon how they work this leave business out. It would give me a little longer in England too.\nWill you please thank Rene for her card. It was very thoughtful of her.\nYou don’t say the name of Veras brother - I may know him, it would be a strange coinsidence if I did wouldn’t it!\nThat xmas card I sent you dear is a printed one. Its this Btns idea of a xmas card although I don’t think a terrible lot of it. There was another type which was a piece of white paper with the badge in gold on the front very small but I choose the other.\nIf I knew where Eddie was darling I would see my officer and try and get a truck to see him but its hopeless without knowing his whereabouts. Holland is a big place and we don’t see RAMC where we are. We are not allowed to leave our area unless detailed to a special place.\nI cannot answer any more just now darling as I have a stack of letters to write dearest. Please forgive me if I have not kept to the lines but the light is pretty poor. Believe me dear I am always thinking of you and longing to see you again.\nBye bye darling, I shall always love you.\nYours for Ever,\nBern\n"

You may get fed up dear with not recieving any letters but I’m just as fed up with not being able to write.\nLast week I was shaving in water with ice floating in it and I slept on my towl to stop that from being frozen stiff as cardboard. My soap even had an ice covering. They certainly have a winter here. Where we are now we are able to visit the civy house and its a real treat to sit arround the fire.\nThank you darling for your letters, I will now try and answer all questions (if there are any).\nI should have thought to got some toys for Colin whilst I was at Brussels but there was so much to do in so little time that my brain didn’t work fast enough.\nI don’t mind dyed hair dear but its when it changes into about 4 different colours (which it always does when the hair grows) its horrible. Dyed hair never looks natural anyway.\nYou would not make much of a living if you had to rely on guesses dear I should love to hear some of your discussions about where we have been; I bet everyone is wrong.\nI am afraid I shall not be home this month dearest but I hope to be on leave about the first or second week in Febuary. The January list is out and I am almost next so I should be at the Top of Feb.\nI had quite a nice christmas. It was inconvienent to hold our feast on 25th so we held it on 31st. We had a decent Xmas dinner and had the band to play to us from 12-2 during dinner. \nSome time ago I was put in for an award but a sergeant got it instead. On the 31st I was presented by the Div. commander with a congratulation card, its not much but will make quite a nice souvenior (spelt WRONGLY). If I can get a big envelope I will send it home, otherwise I’ll bring it when I come. I’m glad I’ve got it - I can shove it under the nose of any of theese sort of chaps who win wars on their own.\nJohnie Leach comes home next week so I expect mum will get some of the dope when she goes round. Roll on Febuary - isn’t it grand darling altho its nowhere near as long as I should like but we must be thankful for small mercies. Lets home nothing turns up to stop leave.\nI must close now dear. Remember dearest, I love you more every day and am praying that this shall finish soon so that we can be together always.\nGive my love to all at 59, don’t worry dear I’m waking special care of myelf.\nYours For ever,\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx\n"

All our mail comes by air so ofcourse it would be affected by the weather.\nI am very pleased that Warren has allowed you time off for when I come home - it will be grand with no excuses to make up - being ill or something.\nI’m afraid I cannot give you the date yet dear as the list has not yet been drawn up for Febuary but I will let you know as soon as I can even if its only a slip with the date on it. Ofcourse we shall go to a show dear if you would like. It will be a nice change for me too.\nWhen I know the date will you please book them dear during the week and not at the weekend as most likely we shall have a bit of a party or something.\nThe weather is still a bit of a terner with stacks of snow. In places it nearly comes up to my knees.\nI cannot think of any more for the present dearest, except that I love you and am looking for the day when we meet again for the first time for 9 months.

Thank you for your letters dated 6th + 8th darling which I recieved last night.\nI hope you were successful in obtaining your shoes dear and got the type which you wanted.\nI saw a good show at Helmond the day before yesterday. It was a variety & panto combined and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Tonight I am going to a cinima but I don’t know the name of the film.\nI hope Rene is alright and everything is settled by the time Eddie comes home. When he comes home perhaps you can get some dope from him so that I can contact him. I should like to see him if it is at all possible.\nDon’t worry dear I don’t stick my neck out for medals (one doesn’t get time to think about those things in action), no-one was more suprised that I was when Mr Rourke told me about a month afterwards that I was recomended for an award but it didn’t come off.\nYou make me mad dear. You know darn well that I would rather you had the money which Bucks may send me. In future, if there is any money or anything for me darling you must have it or I’ll give you a spanking when I come home on leave.\nI still know as much about my leave as I did when I wrote last. One of my mates came back today from Leave in Blity, he came over D day. He had a good time he says but of course the time went too quickly.\nI have been to the pictures which I spoke of earlier in this letter. The film was the hundred pound window and I think very much of it but it was a change.\nI am sitting here quite cosy against a combustion stove which is almost red hot, table & chairs, sipping a mug of hot tea and puffing away at a players. We have a grand lamp equal to electric. It is a parafin pressure lamp (the mantle type) which gives a light equal to the old gas lights. After I have finished this letter I’ll make myself a piece of toast and roll into bed untill one o’clock when I am on stag.\nYou should know by this time darling that I love you deeply and am thinking of you the whole of the day.\nGoodnight darling\nYours for Ever\nBern\n\nonActiveService: true,"

The mail this end is terrible and they come through in dribs & draps which must be on account of the weather.\nWell dear I should be in Ilford on the 4th (not the 3rd as I last wrote). The weather held up the embarkation one day so consequently the whole rota was put back by one day. Therefore if weather permits I’ll be seeing you darling on the 4th, probably during the evening.\nSnow is still making the countryside look like Xmas - its still snowing like billis now. It makes patrolling pretty deadly, roll on summer. The Russians are the boys aren’t they? They’re real heros to bash on in this weather.\nWe are not too badly off, in a house altho it has no roof or windows and the doors wont fit properly. We’ve a full accomplishment of furniture including arm chairs & carpets. Also we are having real home food as we are cooking out own ‘grub and we have one of the cooks here cooking for us. Usually we have company cooking and ofcourse one doesn’t get the same quality food when cooking for 150 as one would for a dozen. We are having pies, pudding, cames, tarts, etc. which we never see in company cooking.\nI cannot think of anything else to write about just now so I will say Goodnight and will hope to see you dearest, on the 4th.\nGoodnight darling I am always thinking of you.\nYours for Ever\nBern\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nPte B Shepherd\nA Coy \n1st Btn R Norfolks\nBLA\n\nMy Darling,\nI have just arrived back to my unit dearest, after a rather hectic journey. I was very unlucky at not getting an extention, most propably you heard or saw that 67 to 70 all got an extention owing to fog in the Straits. We had to hang arround Dover untill Friday for it to clear. I never felt so browned off in all my life. I went to the pictures Thursday evening and saw a realy good film \"Between two Worlds\" I believe the title was.\nLast night we started from Calias at 9 o’clock and arrived at at 12 miday today. We had wooden seats too so sleep was almost impossible.\nThank you darling for the wonderful leave which we had together - I enjoyed it more than anything dear and I hope you did too darling. I shall remember it as long as I live - a small taste of the glorious time we shall have after the war. No one could ever look forward to those ties more than I do dear hardly able to realise that one day they will come true. With our love for each other darling the world will be all ours - for eternity.\nI hope that the work at the office kept you busy when you went back, and that the V2s are not bothering you too much. There is no need to worry about me dear I shall be enjoying myself now for some little while - Bash on the Russians.\nThe time is getting on dear and I must write to mum & dad and also make my bed and arrange things for tomorrow. \nGoodnight darling.\nYours for ever,\nBern\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nPte Shepherd\nA Coy \n1st B. R. Norfolks\nBLA\n\nDarling,\nI am afraid this will not be very long darling not through lack of time but through lack of startling events and thrilling expearances which swells any letter. The weather is just normal and the cat hasn’t had kittens so I’m stumped as per usual!\nI expect I shall be recieving a letter from you in a day or two to say whether or not you just missed a train at Victoria and had to wait half an hour for the next one. It was pretty early when you left so you should have got one easily. I believe dearest, I felt worse coming back off leave than when I was first called up and you can bet my stay in Dover didn’t improve matters at all. I was glad I found some of the boys to go back with as we talked till we got tired then dozed off to sleep.\nI’m not too badly off now in a civy house but not quite as fortunate as Eddie - no civy bed. Still, sleeping on the floor keeps a good crease in ones pants for going out. I seem to sleep just as well on the floor altho for some reason its not quite so comfortable as a feather bed.\nA chap spoke about us on the wireless on Sunday night dear after the 9pm news. I hope you heard it, I didn’t. \nI’m afraid my sweet that the news has all been absorbed in theese few lines but please don’t think because of this little letter I am not thinking of you. Every time I stop my mind shoots back to you like a pin to a magnet, and I find myself day dreaming. I want to be back again with you darling as I was only a few days ago. It does not seem posible that in only a few days, hundreds of miles of land & water can separate us and thousands like us.\nAs I write this letter I feel that you are with me darling - If only I was in Ilford tonight.\nGoodnight darling I love you more than I can ever discribe.\nYours for Ever\nBern\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nPte B Shepherd\nA Coy \n1st Bn R Norfolks\nBLA\n\nMy Darling,\nThank you for all your letters dearest. I have recieved up to No 7. I am sorry I have not written but it has been impossible. I hope you recieved the two field cards which at least told you I was alright.\nIt began to rain so I had to pack up as its impossible to write inside the trench because its too dark. We’ve just had dinner and its getting dark now so I shall have to finish this off tomorrow. I’ll write as much as I can now anyway.\n8th March 1945\nSince I first started this letter we have had rather a busy time dear altho we have made ourselves very comfortable in a barn with bags of straw. I have recieved No 9 letter now, thank you very much but have not seen nothing of No 8. I will now commence to answer them all.\nI am glad Tim managed a few more weekends before he moved from Warley but as your mother said he will get more settled down to the army if he cannot get home every week.\nYou seem to be getting everything done for our wedding darling thank you very much. It must be a terrible job with the coupons dear I wish I was there to help you.\nAre you at the Minories now dearest, or did they change their minds again at the last moment?\nI am going to write to Burnie and thank him for the cigarettes if he sent them, he is a ft sgt isn’t he?\nI’m sorry I have not written much since I’ve been back dear but its not because I have nothing to write about, its because I’ve had no time. Being so good they can’t leave us in the back areas to write letters. The war has got to be finished and we never came out here on holiday.\nI am very sorry to hear that you have been ill dear but hope you are OK now. You don’t get enough fresh air I recon.\nI’m out in all weather but don’t get half as much colds as I did in civy street.\nI have a new officer to look after now dear I expect you will notice the different signiture. His name is Mr Peace. I’m afraid the worst happened to Mr Rourke, he was a jolly fine chap and we all miss him very much. I should like to write a few lines to his wife but it is a very delicate situation, I’ll have a shot at it in a few weeks time.\nThe weather isn’t anything to shout about and theres plenty of mud still hanging around. The summer wants to hurry up and come, another two months should see it through. You know darling that I love you with all my heart and am looking to the day when you are realy mine.\nGoodnight darling I say that to the stars every night just as you told me to.\nYours for ever\nBern\nxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxx\n"

I have not recieved any more as I am doing a spot more signaling with one of the other companies now which of course is delaying my mail.\nI am in 8 platoon dear (as you no dout have noticed in my address) so if he comes to our company you will have to let me know and I’ll look him up. I’m talking of Veras brother ofcourse. I have just wrote and told mum & dad that we are getting married at our next leave and asked them to have a word with you about it as I cannot do much myself so go round and see them sometime please dear.\nThe weather is beginning to look a bit bright now, another month and it should be getting alot milder. Summer makes all the difference for us out here - shorter nights, less guards, less patrols, and ofcourse its warm & dry. Where we are now there is no ration in the egg and milk line. As many eggs as you like for the want of picking them up. Theese chickens must be doing overtime.\nI’m sorry darling but for the life of me I cannot think of any more news just now. All I can think of it when I come home again with the church bells ringing. Let us hope that the war is finished by then so that I can come back for good and we can forget all this and build ourselves a home of our own.\nThey sing \"Wishing will make it so\" so lets hope that the songwriter is a prophet as well darling.\nGive my love to all of 59\nGoodnight Sweetheart,\nYours for Ever\nBern\nxxxx\nxxxx\nxxxx\nxxxx\nxxxx\n x \n"

Lets hope they stay quiet.\nI will send you some money as soon as I get the oportunity dear. You see we get pay days very seldom as no one neads any money as we can’t spend it. I will send you some altho I’m afraid it wont be very much, it will help tho’.\nWas Kitty Finch rather a chubby big girl or am I getting mixed up. I’m afraid I only know most of the girls by sight and not names. I have very little interest in them.\nI think you are silly darling buying a wedding dress when it curtails so many coupons and you can borrow one but ofcourse it is nothing to do with me so please dearest, don’t take any notice of what I think.\nDon’t talk to me about utility furniture darling its all tripe and top prices too. You should see the furniture out here darling solid as a rock, very well designed and just like glass, one can almost see to shave in it.\nWe are living quite well now dear with bags of eggs. We are in quite comfortable billets with a nice spring matress to sleep on when we get the chance.\nAt another house which we visit pretty frequently we get 50 to 70 eggs per day and between about 10 of us it goes down a treat.\nThe other day out Menu down there was this. boiled egg for breakfast. Fried egg, roast fillet of steak, fried onions, roast spuds & fried bread for dinner with preserved fruit for sweet. For Tea we had 2 eggs on toast & chips. All but the bread came from this house, so at least they weren’t doing to badly were they. Ofcourse it was all home grown.\nThe weather is grand now so lets hope it stays this way, it makes things alot easier for us and the raf boys can get cracking. \nI hope darling the V2s are not troubling you very much, altho I know you would not say so if they were. \nAll I say about Dennis & Co if they had a sample of a spot of bother out here they would willingly work at Bucks for nothing rather than stop here.\nYou can never guess how much I am looking forward to the time when we are together again and to the day when I come home for good. I hope its not too far away dearest.\nBye bye sweetheart\nYours darling for ever\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx\n"

I am still doing signal work at HQ but hope to be with the platoon again soon.\nI have just written a letter to Burnie giving him some of the news and asking him whether he would like to perform at the wedding. Ofcourse there is a chance they he will be abroad by that time even if he is still in England now.\nThank you very much for the parcel darling; I’m realy made up with the mirror, I’ve had 3 or 4 glass ones but they havent lasted very long and its much easier to shave when one can see whats what.\nThe chocolate was very nice too dear but I wish you wouldn’t send me your ration as I get my chocolate just as you do and I know you like it.\nThe weather is still keeping pretty good and the boys are certainly bashing on well over the Rhine aren’t they? I don’t think it will last much longer out here now. What with Russia stabbing him one way and us the other hes in a bit of a sandwich. We found letters written by a girl to a soldier in Russia (or he was in Russia when they were written) and an RA officer who was with us could read german. According to the letter the bombing was terrible and she said that the towns were gratualy being inialated and the war couldn’t last mich longer. They were dated 1942!\nSo you’ve cut off your curls have you, good job I’m not home else there’d be a row of no uncertain manner but as long as they are replaced by the time I come home again I can’t do much about it.\nIt sounds as though Eddie is enjoying himself if he is out at rest as you think, he is certainly having a long one.\nNo I’m afraid I don’t know Ellas boy Holland. I might know him by sight, maybe mum would. Is she going pretty strongly with him or is it the same as usual?\nWe’ll split the difference with the house situation darling. We’ll have central heating with no windows, doors, or roof. I think its a fine idea only having one bridesmaid dear especially in wartime when everything is so expensive and couponed.\nIts a pity you had a terrible journey to seven oaks as it as it was a decent change for you. It is a great pity get those table cloths etc as they would have come in handy but never mind.\nYou didn’t say what you surmised those for train companions were doing on the train from Seven oaks. I should like to hear it as I bet you are entirely wrong. Women again!\nI will close now dearest, I shall always love you and long for the day when we are together again.\nYours for Ever,\nBern\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nPte B Shepherd\nA Coy \n1st Bn R Norfolk\nBLA\n\nMy Darling,\nI have some time to pass away so I’ll write a letter. This sort of weather one feels like writing but when its freezing cold & miserable and maybe wet letterwriting is terrible. It keeps lighter too of an evening which helps alot. Thank you for your letter dearest, glad to sat I am still quite well and safe and you have nothing to worry about.\nMum wrote and said that you had been round to her place the other night.\nI expect I shall be hearing how Mrs Fountain is and also the baby in your next letter. Have you heard anything of Mrs Scott lately?\nI suppose Rene has decided that the war should be over by the time that she got to Manchester. I hope hope the gardening which you did in place of the journey was successfully carried out. I hope the weather is such when I come home again that we shall be able to use it. It will be grand darling if the weather is glorious.\nHave you anywhere or anyone to go to dearest, for the honeymoon?\nOK dear I shall never say \"I don’t know what to write about\" again, altho you must admit it fills up a few more empty lines when short of news.\nNow the history of the missing (you guessed right) Torch. When I landed in France it was working 100% but apparently Holland didn’t agree with it and on arrival there it refused to light. I put it in my overcoat and overcoats were handed in when we went into the next scrap. After we had taken our objective sometime later the o/coats came up in the dark when it was impossible to sort them out so it was a case of ‘take as you come’. Since then I’ve seen neither the coat or its contents but I’ve a better coat out of the bargain. Heres a bit of luck I had in that do. I had a bullet go right through my pouch which (if you remember) I carry in front of me and put paid to a tin of bully which was inside. I didn’t discover it untill I fancied a bit of corned beef a few days later. I also had one through my water bottle. I was running and I felt something hit me and thought I had been hit as the water ran down my leg. When I got into a suitable position I investigated. Needles to say the bottle was of no more use. Its the best of being thin dear they can’t possibly hit you.\nI am still doing signal work dear altho now I am back with my own company and hope to be with the platoon in about two days. Altho one doesn’t see quite so much of Jerry in HQ. I would rather be with eight Ptn as I always have been with them in every action even though they are different chaps for the most part.\nDid Veras brother come to this Batalion after all? I don’t suppose so else you would have said.\nI will close now dearest, and write again as soon as I get the oportunity.\nGoodnight darling and God bless you.\nYours for Ever,\nBern\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\n"

I’m sorry I have kept you waiting for some time but we’ve been helping Jerry to evacuate some of his troops, and others to advance through our lines to the P.O.W. cage. On my Conteinental tour I am still staying in Germany and trade is pretty good now, altho we expect it to slacken off in a month or so. Anway, organized resistance should not last much longer now, should it? Ofcourse isolated pockets will carry on for sometime after no dout.\nWe are having some glorious weather here which makes things much more pleasent. I expect England is much the same altho here they get hotter summers and colder winters.\nI almost forgot to mention that I recieved the cigarettes which you sent darling thank you very much.\nThings are very quiet now, alot different to the old Normandie days when a trench was the only thing which one thought about. Where we are now we are very comfortable and wouldn’t mind staying for the duration. Ofcourse now we are here we must not have anything to do with the civies but I am very suprised at the way some behave. Many speak quite good English and appear to be very friendly but we just take no notice. Ofcourse should they offer us a few eggs we don’t say no but we have to take them in any case so whats the odds? We have to be very careful as some of the \"soldiers of the master race\" who grow tired of fighting try to evade us by dressing in civilian clothes. They take a bit of detecting but I don’t think many get away with it.\nHow are the arrangements going darling? Everything apple pie order I hope, and the dress - how about that? The days are slipping by aren’t they dear. Before you know where you are I shall be home again and the war will be over for good I hope. Like you dear the time seems to be slipping by quickly and yet it seems ages since I was home last.\nI am still with the signals and look as tho I have the job perminant. At the moment I am on duty on the telephone, there are 3 of us and we work with 3 hr shifts. Last night I was on fron 1 till 4 which is not a very good time. I’ll get some kip this afternoon tho to make up for it.\nI cannot think of any thing else to write about except that I love you more than I can possibly write. Bye bye darling I’ll write again soon if the situation permits.\nYours for Ever,\nBern\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\n"

With the shortage of stuff one can hardly choose theese days. You are not in the same position as us who can just walk into a house, shop, or factory and help ourselves. We’ve an accordian here which one of the boys aquired and Ivve been enjoying myself for half an hour or so. I’d sooner be in Holland where one can talk to the civies and be liberators. We were just beginning to be able to talk Dutch (very brokenly) so that we were understood. I’m in favour of Canvey darling for our honeymoon as long as its not too late in the year. If its in September the weather should be nice. What about your grandfather dear where would he go?\nI had thought of the idea that you spoke of buying a bed but was waiting to see whether you would say anything.\nI havent recieved Burnies letter yet but I’ll make my decision then. I will otherwise ask Claude which will please Mum - Dad more.\nThe weather is lovely here now dear and glad to say things are pretty quiet again. We now hold more of Germany than what Jerry does and according to what he is saying over the Radio they are not very confident of the outcome. What a pity.\nI am like you dearest, eagerly awaiting that day of days when we shall be together again and I am sure that we shall be as happy as any other couple has ever been.\nGoodnight darling & God bless you.\nYours for ever\nxxxxxxxxxx Bern xxxxxxxxxxxx\nP.S.

I’m glad to say I’m quite safe & well, hoping dear that you are the same and that you are now back at work once more.\nI expect you have heard about us on the news as we have been mentioned quite a few times. We have been making history which will be in books for generations to come. Thats the reason we’ve been unable to write. \nYes dear thats one terrible thing about Germany, we are not allowed to have anything to do with any german, not even the nicest of girls. When we enter a town or village the civies are realy terrified by what the SS have said we will do to them but they soon get over it.\nYes dear I’m still with the signals. Both sigs and back at the Platoon have their advantages but one great bug-bare with the sigs, there are only 3 of us we have to split the night between us. We do 3 hours a piece at night & 5 hrs during the day. I did from 12 to 3 last night which is ‘nix good’.\nI hope that Beryl is OK now and that those pains were nothing serious. One thing I’ve discovered about women they are always ready to pack everyone else off to the doctors at the least sign of a cold but they think they can crawl about half dead without any nead themselves.\nI have not said anything about going away to Mum & Dad yet because I’m not quite certain whether everything is arranged yet. Will you let me know darling I shall be disappointed if we don’t go away for a few days.\nI think we now have the Boche where we want them now, eh dear? I can’t understand this Unconditional surrender to U.S. & us only. At that rate it can’t be unconditional. It wont last long now though and Germany wont be able to start another one in a hurry. Her railways, factories, towns & villages infact everything is smashed to the ground. She has paid for the bombing of Britain very dearly.\nWe have had a bit of rain the last couple of days but on the whole the weather is very nice. We have some decent billets so its OK. A few days ago we had a smashing place. The 3 signals had a basement flat of a big house used most probably by the housekeeper. We had a bed each, a kitchen, a wash room and also a bathroom. We only stopped there one night, did we say something!\nI will finish off now darling and drop a line to mum & dad.\nBye bye darling I’ll write again soon if they will allow me. I’m am always thinking of you darling and looking forward to the future more than anything in the world.\nYours for Ever,\nBern\nxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxx\n"

If one keeps going in they are bound to get it in the end but luckily the war didn’t last long enough for me to get a packet. There are very few of the old boys left now. When we heard about the news of the German surrender we dug into some rum which we had and had a singsong. The following day we had a concert with yours truly in the band with an accordian. It wasn’t too bad but we need a bit of practise.\nWe have started the spit & polish here and are reverting to peacetime standard but I can do all that if there are no more shells & bullets shooting arround. Any way darling there is no need to worry about me any more.\nI wonder whether you guessed it from the news & the papers. We were the troops or some of them who took Bremen. It is a huge place with high buildings and similar to London but the Raf & american airforce had certainly knocked it about. We didn’t stop there long as we were required elsewhere.\nBy all accounts our future role will certainly be a feather in our caps for this division. The standard of the guards will be put in the shade by the time we are finished.\nFor the last few days the weather has been grand darling and lets hope we get no more rain like last week. At that time we were in a Bungalow with only half a roof and the rain poured through. We found the owner of the house who was only too willing to replace the roof so after that we had no more water in the house.\nWe have a very nice billet now tho’, its a german camp - the finest I’ve ever seen. They certainly look after the German Army. All brick huts all done out with a lovely cream with smashing lighting, central heating and every convenience. I hope we are here for some time.\nI expect England went made with the Ve day holiday didn’t they? I hope you enjoyed yourself darling.\nI’m afraid I havent time to answer all your letters now so I’ll write another tomorrow and answer them then. With the war now over leave will be speeded but darling and I expect I shall be home before the summer fades out. wont it be grand darling with a summer wedding and a few lovely days at canvey.\nI can hardly wait.\nGoodnight darling I love you as no one else could.\nYours for Ever & ever\nBern\n"

I have been away on holiday at the divisional Club for four days which is in Holland. The weather was grand and its a lovely place, a hotel with hugh swimming pools surrounded by fine sand and thick woods all arround. In the hotel waiters dashed arround in coat tails & black bows etc and a band playing at meals. In the town there were two civy pictures showing American films, an Ensa show and a Garison cinema. The time flashed by.\nI’ll now answer your letters 36, 37, 38, 39.\nI hope you enjoyed the peace celebrations at home. For us we were roaring on V day packed (as per usual) in 3 ton lorries. Everything was taken as a matter of course out here, I expect the boys further back who had never heard a gun go off did all the celebrating.\nWill you let me know when you have fixed up a place to stay at Canvey darling then I’ll let mum & dad know.\nThere is no need to start worrying dearest, as to whether I shall go out Burma way because we have a job to do out here. If things are not changed we are to represent the British army in Berlin. I got a brand new suit today which I shall not be wearing very much and should be toned down just right for when I come home. I shouldn’t like a brand new suit for the wedding darling as they have that anti-vermine powder in them which makes them look funny but it soon comes out with a bit of wear. They are more particular about the fit now, this one is just the job.\nThere is no more censoring now dear which is much better. I never did like other people reading my letters to you darling.\nOfcourse you are right about the bed dear I have applied for a form and also my credits (about a week ago) so that I could send you some money but they have not come through yet. You know what the army is. Before jerry packed in we were continually in action and things were difficult so I couldn’t do it before.\nYes, we’re a bit of a band here dear 2 squeese boxes, piano, trumpet & a side drum. We had a minstral show last night and had to black our faces and wore brilliant clothing. The only trouble was washing afterwards. The accordian I play doesn’t belong to me, it belongs to the company. All the instruments were requisitioned by the coy and are carried by our transport. Thats a batalion order.\nI’m afraid I’ve no idea when I shall be home darling but it shouldn’t be too long. I should imagine about the end of July or August but that is only a wild guess.\nHas Tim yet said what was wrong with his leg dear? He is having a good rest anyway - hes started drinking then but appearantly he doesn’t smoke.\nSo you’re going to get me drunk on our wedding night, eh? Whats the idea - I’ll have a thick head in the morning don’t forget. It wont take much more than a couple of pints as I havent had any for so long. If I get drunk I’ll make sure that you can’t stand first darling. If I get the chance I’ll bring some spirits home dear but there is none about here at all. The countries out here have been as wat just as long as England and with thousands of troops out here its pretty short. One has to be very careful of such stuff as many chaps have been bad with stuff made with methelated spirits.\nThe only thing to do with Lee is to wait till he brings the subject up then tell him you were joking, unless you don’t tell him the date. You shouldn’t say such things to people like Lee should you darling?\nI am looking forward to my next leave just as you are darling and even more to the day when class 47 of the demob group no longer exist in the army. The years can then go as slowly as they wish and I shall be happy forever.\nGoodnight darling\nYours for Ever\nBern\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\n\nP.S. Thank you for ordering the cigs dear I’ll let you know when to send some more dear (as you said in your letter) when we get to a place where we are likely to stay for a considerable time. At present we are still at the German Camp..\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nPte B Shepherd\nA Coy \n1st Royal Norfolks\nBLA\n\nMy Darling,\nThank you for your letters dear I’ll will write to you as often as I can but as I expect you know by now I had 4 days in Holland and I didn’t write. \nThe weather is not so good as it was a week or so ago. While I was away I got so red as a beetroot but it is going off again now.\nMy demob No is 47 dear so I anticipate quite a long stretch to ‘do’ yet dearest. Ofcourse Eddie has been in the Kate quite a long time - I’m only a rookie in comparison.\nI hope to be able to give you a rough date of my next leave shortly. I have asked the Clerk in the office to work it out but hes been to busy up to now. I’ll have to start getting on to him. It seems years since I was home last. My favourite hymn is ‘For those in peril on the sea’ but its not very appropriate for the occation so I should skip it. Don’t worry about my pjyamas dearest, I’ll see about them.\nNo dear I’ve had no letter from Burnie yet, I think I’ll write and ask Claude to be best man as its been a long time since I wrote. It seems funny that he hasn’t answered it, doesn’t it?\nI had a letter from Mrs Rourke (The officers, who got killed, wife) She wrote a very nice letter - until she recieved my letter she was hoping it was a mistake. I told her everything about the action in which he got killed except that he was blown to pieces and we reconised him only by the brown american boots he was wearing. Now its rather awkward as she asks if I could find out what happened to his wallet, ring, & cigarette case as she would treasure such things very much. She has recieved the rest of his kit which he wasn’t carrying. She is very eager to see me and I said in my letter that I would go round and see his people who live in London when I come in leave. She said that if I could possibly manage it she would come to London (she lives in Wales) to see me. So don’t say I havent warned you.\nWe are still doing drilling and sports here. Marching up & down the streets etc, cross country runs, football & games.\nIts a pity you’re not like Ella dearest, as I can’t write Happy love letters no matter how hard I tried. One of theese days I’ll try it when I feel in the mood. \nBut untill then darling you must be content with my usual Goodnight.\nGoodnight dearest, its lovely to think that I’ve you waiting there for me when I come home again.\nYours for Ever\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nPte Shepherd\nA Coy \n1st Royal N\nBLA\n\nDarling Kath,\nI was very pleased to recieve your letter dear to say that it was all arranged for us to go to Canvey for a few days. Yes dear you showed me the caravan when we were at Canvey. Its a lovely one isn’t it? I hope the weather is nice. I should get my leave about the first or second week in August, it wont be before then and most likely will be the first week but there is nothing definate. You should, I think, ask Aunt Clara as she is letting us have the caravan and also you promised her. Actually, I can’t see why you should ask Mrs Sharpe as you don’t seem very friendly with her but ofcourse I can’t judge such things as I don’t know much about her.\nThe shortage of man power is a bit overwhelming but I can’t see that it can be helped much. If you had a man for every woman you would need to have an extra house to put them in. I can’t see how you will seat them all if you have anymore. How many do you think you can seat?\nI should be going to Brussels very shortly dear and I’ll see if I can get anything there altho it would have to be small as I can’t carry very much. As it is, with ‘buckshe’ kit I’ve got I’ve almost more than I can carry now. If you think of anyhting I can get I’ll try and get it but 10 to 1 with all the troops that have been there stuff will be scarce. I’ll try and get some stockings anyway. I didn’t see any last time. With Brussels turning up I can’t get any money out of credit else I shall have none then so I’ve sent home for a form so that mum can draw it out (or you can come to that). Will £10 be enough dear or would you like more?\nThe weather here isn’t too good now adays. For about a week when I went to Div club the weather was wonderful but now its dull with occasional rain. I hope June alters its tune a bit.\nI forgot to tell you in my last letter that we had some freed Russians come and give us a show the other day. It included a hundred Russian girls. The show wasn’t very good but we gave them a dance afterwards. The dance included all the novelty dances - \"Conga\" \"Hokey Kokey\" \"St Bernards Walse\" etc and the girls didn’t know them. You should have seen our chaps trying to explain them. The boys couldn’t speak Russian & the Ruskies couldn’t speak English. Last night we had a professional Russian show here but I didn’t go and see it. A couple of days ago I saw a film about Minden (about 20 miles from here) called \"Janey\" but didn’t think much of it.\nI will close now dearest, and write to Mum & Dad. You’ll never know how much I am looking forward to my next leave but more still to the day when I shall be Mr Shepherd instead of Pte.\nBye bye dearest, I love you with all my heart. \nYours for ever & ever\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nPte Shepherd\nA Coy \n1st Royal N\nBLA\n\nMy Darling,\nThank you very much for your letter dear which I recieved when I got back from Brussels.\nI had a grand time at Brussels, I’ve stayed in a marvelous hotel and shared an apartment with a mate of mine whom I went with. We arrived there at 5 o’clock on Wednesday and returned at 7 on Saturday so we had quite a long stay. The apartment we had was wonderfuly finished with two hugh soft beds, double inset wardrobe and a dressing table, two easy chairs & table. Telephone by the bed and buttons for calling the maid or waiter. Also a private bathroom, washbasins, etc. Tea was brought in at 7:30 every morning by men and everything was run at a £3 a day hotel should be run. Breakfast 8 till 9:30, Dinner 12:30 till 2 Soup, a smashing dinner & sweet Tea 3:30, 4:30 salads etc. - Supper 6-7:30 soup, either steak or chops & veg and usually ice cream. - Snack from 10 till midnight, tea, coffie, cakes & bisciuts. A light orchester in attendance from dinner time until midnight. The night before we came away they gave us a convert from 10 till 12:00.\nI saw some good films there. \"The Woman at the Window\", \"To have & have not\", \"Tarzan finds a Son\", and \"Kidnapped\". Brussels is almost completely English now, everyone speaks it and all placards etc are in English with Belguim & French underneath. I got four films whilst I was there which should help. There were stacks of them there. I sent you a card while I was there which I hope you have recieved.\nI shall not be home before the beginning of August anyway darling so you have at least two months and most likely more to prepare things. It is a lot to do on your own darling and I wish I could help you but I can’t do much out here, can I? You should be able to seat a lot at the breakfast, I was forgetting about the two rooms.\nI’m afraid darling if you wanted to draw any money you would have to have my Co op book which mum has at present. If you do borrow any money darling you know there will be no worry about paying it back since I’ll do that when I come home.\nWe have the day off today as its June 6th and everyone is up at the fun fair & sports now. Tonight ATS are comming here and having a dance. I am on duty today so I miss it but I can’t grumble as I’ve just returned from Brussels. I have the afternoon off tomorrow.\nI can hardly realise that in about two months time dearest, you will be my wife and will be the happiest man in the world, and for a few days will taste the happiness which will be ours for the rest of our lives. When the wonderful times which we have had during my leaves will be nothing in comparison. A love so deap that nothing can shift it. Who could blame me with someone like you.\nGood night my darling, my heart yearns for you more every day.\nYours for Ever\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nPte B Shepherd\nA Coy \n1st Royal Norfolks\nBLA\n\nMy Darling,\nThank you so much for your letters, so glad you recieved the handkerchief OK.\nYes dear I asked mum to get my pyjamas but not because I don’t think you would get the right sort but because of two other reasons which you will have to admit to yourself are true even if you don’t admit it to me. FIrstly the coupons which you are having to use pretty heavily, secondly you’ve got quite a lot to do as it is and thirdly mum has got my money to use. I’m not in the least particular about the colour of them.\nI had a look arround in Brussels but there was nothing there.\nYes, its funny not hearing from Burnie but anyway I’ve already asked Claude now as it looks bad asking him at the last moment. Maybe Burnie has gone straight overseas or something. One can never tell.\nI’ll try and write my letters a bit different dearest, I’m not promising any good results though. I’ll try and stop making you freeze up with my writing darling. I don’t mind sloppy letters dear.\nI’m darn sure I wouldn’t let my wife tell me what to do. I’d show her whos boss with a capital B. I believe in chaining ‘em up & whipping them till they beg for mercy! Its a lovely sensation.\nId you havent decided upon having a tooth by the time I get home I’ll soon say what my verdict is (as if you’d take any notice of that).\nNo, I completely forgot to tell Mum & Dad when I wrote that we would spend a few days at Canvey but I will next time. Canvey - a place we shall remember as long as we live. There on our own to do as we please dearest, no one to interupt us, no clock to worry us, infact darling every thing as we have always wanted it. I often think of those grand times even though it makes me want to be with you more than anything in the world. I love you as I could never love anyone else - and never want to anyone else. Only you will do. Never mind darling we shall be able to make up for this long parting as soon as I come back to you for good.\nWe had a bit of a \"do\" here last night. During the day we had rigged up sideshows, darts, \"racehorses\", turntables, knocking down cans and quite a few more. During the evenng we had this fair followed by a consert then Beer, sandwiches, rolls & cakes which the cooks got up. Finaly we had a singsong and we all realy enjoyed ourselves. There is an ENSA show on tomorrow night at BHQ which I expect I shall see. We get Saturday & Sunday afternoons off now and there isn’t usually much on Sunday mornings. Its usually reserved for church, parade or mending, cleaning and polishing. The weather here is not at all bad now dear. From when went to Brussels it has turned over a new leaf. (Touch wood.)\nWe have a new company commander now dear well when I say new, he was in charge of this coy some months back but got wounded. The other one was a bit of a so-&-so so its a good riddance as the one is a decent chap.\nOur 2nd I/C one of the best offices I’ve ever known has been made up to Major & is in command of another company but the new chap we have is his place seems alright.\nI cannot think of any more news darling so I will close for the time being but promise to write again soon.\nGoodnight sweetheart, all my love is for you dearest\nYours for ever\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx\n"

Sorry I havent written but time has flashed by and I seem to have had no time at all. I also recieved a very nice letter from your mother yesterday.\nL/Cpl Davies typed the envelope, he is one of the signal blokes. He was typing one out for himself so I called him to do one for me. Ofcourse if I had done it it would have been perfect!\nTo have & have not is a very good film and well worth seeing when it comes round.\nI am very pleased you were able to get the bed darling also the mattress. I do wish I was there to give you a hand. We’ll see about the other things when I get home altho there wont be much time for that will there. Anyway darling we can discuss things.\nIf Burnie was comming to the wedding dear he would at least written wouldn’t he? Something must have happened, don’t you think?\nI didn’t say (or at least didn’t mean to say) that I was going to buy any special small thing in Brussels but that if I saw anything I would buy it if it were small enough to carry arround.\nNothing very exciting has happened here just the normal old routine. We had a parade the other day for the orientation of some more of those certificates to men who had done there stuff in the more recent battles.\nThe weather wasn’t too good here yesterday but its been glorious today and the sun shining the whole time. I did some washing this morning and its dried beautifully. One shirt 2 hanks & 3 prs socks.\nI have no more news about my leave date yet darling as no alotments have yet come thro from Batt HQ for July & August.\nI hope darling it isn’t long as I’m getting very impatient and look forward to it more & more each day. All I can say is I love you with all my heart and alway will. We shall be the happiest couple in the world\nYours for ever\nBern\nxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxx\nP.S.

      "letter":"14232057\nPte Shepherd\nA Coy \n1st Bn The Royal Norfolks\nBLA\n\nMy Darling,\nAt last dear I have the date of my leave and its earlier than was expected. I arrive home on the 18th of July so we can easily get married on the Saturday darling that is of course if you can arrange everything by then. I do hope so dearest.\nI shall not attempt to explain why I havent written much lately for as your letter states dear I’m pretty good at giving excuses. I’ll let you guess ‘em.\nI am glad Tim will be able to get home for the wedding dear tho it shook me when I heard that Claude was on embarkation Leave. It wouldn’t matter if he was comming out here but its pretty definate that he wont isn’t it.\nThe weather has been grand up till last night when it started to rain and has been the same ever since. We have moved (just A coy) to Minden and have been errecting a camp for the last week to hold 6000 Russian slave workers. They come here for 24 hrs on their way back to Russia, get fed, washed & cleaned up and sleep the night then continue on their journey. We had to work like slaves to get it completed in time and finished it at 5’oclock yesterday morning - the first lot arrived at eight! As one lot leave one way to the station so lorry loads roll up at the other entrance and so it goes on. There are 200 germans there working the camp while we supervise which is no easy job. You allot so many to a tent and turn your back and they’re all over the place. They hang arround when you want them to move & move when you don’t want them to - They can’t understand English and what they say might just as well be Chineese! We have to have about 30 on guard every night as theese Ruskies wouldn’t think twice about knocking off a jerry & taking what they fancied. I’ve got the day off today as I was on guard yesterday & lastnight. Tomorrow I’m a copper directing the trafic.\nLast week I had 48 hrs leave at the Britannia club which is run by this Batt. It is a big house on top of a hill surrounded by woods which in peace time was a favourite hunting ground as many wild creatures hang arround there. It is beautiful scenery and being smashing weather I enjoyed it thoroughly. Trucks took us to a vilage of an evening for pictures &, if desirous, a drink of beer at a nearby cafe. I must close now darling hoping to write again very soon. If only I had you in my arms tonight.\nYours for ever\nBern\nxxx xx xx\nxxxxxxxx\n xxxxx\n"

Its funny but when jerry was slinging muck over & bullets whistling by I didn’t get in too bad a state (well, thats my reputation anyway but I wont say how I felt at times) but when it comes to making myself an exhibit infront of an audince I’m wacked.\nWe are still here at Minden looking after the Russians and things are going very smoothly and nothing very excited has happened. We are in houses here and quite comfortable. I was taken off the signal role last week as 2 sigs can manage this job OK now as there is very little to do. Yesterday, however, Dave went on leave & I have taken over again untill he comes back.\nWe had a smashing time at Bn HQ last night. There was a dance on & I & 4 of my mates went down there as there was bags of drink. Don’t worry darling I didn’t even look at an ATS (I wouldn’t because I know I’ve got you dear). There was Beer, Gin & Brandy, each at 3d so it wasn’t an expensive evening. There we met 3 of our officers who splashed out and also my old sargeant who got wounded on the Rhyne and who only returned that day so we had not seen him before. After the dance two of them started a fight with an HQ corporal and the adj. had to part them. I felt like a dying duck this morning.\nI am getting very excited dearest, as the time creaps by. In a fortnights time dearest, I shall be away from here London bound. I leave here on the 16th and arrive home on the 18th. Only 16 days time - can you realise it dear? Its unbelievable to me darling. In 3 weeks time you will be my wife if you don’t change your mind. I don’t know what I’d do if you did, Volunteer for Burma, I think! I know you wont tho’, will you dearest?\nI must close now as its getting late and I must turn in before lights go out.\nGoodnight dear if you’re looking forward to my leave as much as I am then you are happy - so am I\nGoodnight Kath\nYours For Ever\n"

You shouldn’t get so upset dear you know I’m quite safe, don’t you?\nIts worked out marvelously hasn’t it dear. Eddie coming home on the 16th and I on the eighteenth. I hope Tim can get up, I expect it is too much to think Claude would be able too.\nI have not yet recieved any word from Burnie, whether he has my address wrong or hasn’t had time I don’t know but it seems funny. Send me his address next time you write will you please dear?\nYes dear I shall get eleven days leave and I’m looking forward to it more than you’ll ever guess. Another fortnight and it will be the eve of our wedding. A dream come true.\nWe are still looking after theese Russians and some of them are getting a bit out of hand. Altho we keep a strict guard on them, some of them get out and try to get their own back on some unlucky german civy. They burnt one chaps shed down one night, raided a house another, and two or 3 jerrys have been bashed about. One Russian drank a pint of army petrol and died.\nThey found an ammo dump and started firing cary lights all over the place and last night one of the tents caught fire. The reason for all theese occurances is that this batch of Ruskies have been here for 5 days now owing to the shortage of Transport for them and they are beginning to get restless. Luckily they go tomorrow or goodness knows what will happen.\nI’ve been into town a couple of times since I last wrote. The first time I saw a film called Something for the boys\" in technicolour which was quite good. Last night I went and saw a real tip top Navy show \"Pisific Showboat\" the best show I’ve seen for a long time. It lasted 2 ½ hrs.\nTheres quite a bit of discussion going on in the office now. The News Chronicle which we recieved today, has quite a bit in it about a Boxer Ginger Sadd who has just started boxing again. It said that he had been wounded whilst on patrol in the R Norfolk Rgt by a german officer who shot him by pretending to give himself up. Ginger Sadd was in A coy and in actual fact shot himself in the hand with a sten just before an attack in France. Whether it was an Accident or not we don’t know but some people can certainly spin some yarns. Our company commander is taking the matter up - he can’t get away with that.\nI cannot think of anymore news darling but just think of the fortnights time which for a few days will be absolute heaven.\nI know that we shall be realy happy for the rest of our lives dearest, and our whole lives will be like an endless dream.\nGoodnight my dearest, I love you as I could never love anyone else.\nYours for Ever\nBern\nxxxx\nxxxx\nxxxx\nxxxx\n xxxx\n xxxx\n xxxx\n xxxx\n xxxx\n xxxx\n xxxx\n xxxx\n"

Now they have all gone we have started a training programn. The worst thing being half an hours Physical Training before breakfast. Still better then than later on when it gets hot. I could have gone out last night but I had seen both films and I didn’t fancy the Ensa show. \n\"St Joan\" which was a dramatic play of Joan of Arc. Instead I stayed in and ammused myself doing a bit of cleaning which ended up in a barrack room fight with anything everyone could lay their hands on.\nAt the moment I’m sitting in the office looking through the window at the traffic etc. The sun is shining gloriously and as we are right on a main road there is plenty to see. The three telephones which are on my deck are unusually quiet, I’ve got a mug of char and a packet of cigarettes so I’m pretty well fixed up. We get tea every morning at 10:30. Well thats all the ‘grift’ of whats happened lately darling now for a topic which is getting more excited the minutes go by. In 4 days or 92 hours I shall be on my way from here coming to you dearest, and from the 21st onwards will be a dream for ever. You can never realise how much it means to me dearest, and if you feel the same as I do darling my next leave will be the happiest ever. I only hope that the weather keeps fine as I believe it will and Canvey be a place which will always be stamped in my memory.\nBye By darling I promised you this would only be a short letter so I hope you are not too disappointed. I love you with all my heart sweetheart, and never want to love anyone else - noone could ever take your place. Au Revoir dear give my love to Mum & Rene\nYours for Ever\nBern\nxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxx\n\n\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nPte Shepherd B\nSignal Ptn\n1st Bn Royal Norfolk \nBAOR\n\nMy Darling Wife,\nWell dear I’ve arrived back safely to this dreaded country. I arrived soon after 5 tonight after having the worst journey ever through the continent, and goodnes knows, the others were bad enough.\nI left Victoria at 12 midnight on Saturday and the train ran into Folkstone instead of dover. Through not giving us an extention 27 group 28 and 29 were all going through together and they had a job finding room for us all. Another chap & I were put in a little room on our own where we went to bed. The next thing I knew was the other chap shaking me saying it was 10:30 and everyone else had gone. We got a cup of tea in the cookhouse and went with another lot at eleven o’clock. The croud we were with went at 5am and forgot to call us. It didn’t matter as we caught them up at Calias. We caught a train at Calias at 8pm and arrived at Krefeld (Germany) at 11am. It was the usual wooden seats and no heating. To look out of the window we had to blow on the glass for about 5 minutes to thaw the ice, then it would freeze over again in a couple of minutes. Now I’m back here the billet is freezing. Is it cold in Germany now? Theres no words to discribe it. All the lakes etc are frozen over and all the civies are skating and the children have the sledges out on the ice. There has been some snow here but it didn’t lay as the ground was too wet. I can hardly move my fingers as I write.\nI miss you greatly, my daring, and I know you are feeling the same. Every time I come on leave darling I more & more want to be with you for ever and pray that my demob will come quickly that I may be with the one I love for ever. To come home to you every night darling. I will say no more as I know it will only upset you more than you already are. Thank you for the wonderful time dearest.\nThere was a letter from Burnie waiting for me when I got back. He was very upset as he had been given 14 days leave and after having 2 days was recalled and has been taken off of air crew and places on ground staff. He has been before a board and is now waiting for tjeir desision of what trade he will go in. He says he will either be an Air movement Assistant, a driver or clerk. Its a shame isn’t it? Appearantly the airforce is as bad as the army as he has just come off of an air crews course. He was learning gunnery.\nI had better close now darling and post this letter so that it will go by tomorrows post. Then I will get my things straightened out and unpacked. I brought all the stuff safely here dear without any breakages.\nGoodnight, my darling wife, I love you madly and please never dout me again. I feel like smashing things when I realise where I should be but for this army. One thing I noticed when I was at home dear you seem to have lost your nastly little temper which you had. Had you noticed it dear?\nGoodnight darling\nYour Ever Loving Husband\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nPte Shepherd B\nSignal Platoon\n1st Bn Royal Norfolks\nBAOR\n\nMy Darling Wife,\nI was just going to start your letter darling when I recieved your lovely long one with the paper cutting. Thank you very much dear. I had already read about the \"horsebox leave Trains\". I should call them \"Icebox\" trains myself. I can’t quite swallow the bit about troops breaking 86 windows in one train as I’ve never seen any damage done in any of them by our own chaps. In our carriage there was 3 sitting on seats for two which isn’t too good for 15 hours. I only do a short journey compared to some.\nI’m pleased you got back alright, and I never worried whether you would be alright as I usualy do. I felt rather down in the dumps darling as none of my mates were there and the mucking arround and journey didn’t improve things. I’m more or less settled down to this life again dear but I’m browned off. I always feel browned off and \"don’t care what happens\" feeling when I come back from Leave. This leave especially darling as I think I enjoyed this one better than any other. Its wonderful to think dear that you now know how much you mean to me and not worrying whether I would go out with another girl. I hope you will always believe me dear.\nYes dearest, when the army is just a memory for me and I am back with you, our life will be just as wonderful as my 12 days leave - only it will last for ever and no dreaded thoughts of going back. I shall always do my best to make you happy darling.\nI hope you are sleeping better now dear and you are able to get your feet warm. I can see you’ll have to get a hot water bottle but you wont use it while I’m home, I don’t believe in them. It will soon be spring again and I shall be home for another 12 days. I’m looking forward to my next leave so much dear that I want to keep talking about it but thats silly as I shall have plenty of time for that when it comes.\nI should classify tomorrow for signaller all being well so I must do some swotting dearest, as I’ve forgotten everything since I came on Leave. You’re enough to make anyone loose their head.\nGoodnight, my darling, love you\nYour Ever Loving Husband\nBern\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nPte Shepherd B\nSig Ptn\n1st Bt R. Norfolks\nBAOR\n\nMy Darling Wife,\nThank you for Mondays letters dearest which I recieved yesterday.\nNo dear I don’t suppose you did feel like work Monday, especially as you are not keen on Bucks. It didn’t come so had to me as I enjoy my ‘work’ and there is no work attached to. I kept thinking tho’ dear of what we were doing at the time a week ago and thats what made me mad more than anything.\nI also recieved a greetings card from Claude with ‘Roll on demob’ on it saying he expects there is bags of beer in Germany for Xmas. Some hopes!\nI’m glad you sleep better now darling. The fire is coming in handy now then dear for warming the bedroom.\nIt will be practicaly a weeks holiday for you next week, wont it darling? I hope you enjoy yourself dearest. I don’t know what we are having in the food line for Xmas but we are having it down Britiania Bar. I hopeI’m not on duty. They are holding a dance in the evening, I hope there is some decent beer or something there or else OII shan’t stop for long.\nTheres about 9 of us dance so we’ll find our own ammusement, breaking windows or something. The food here now is very much better than it was before I came on leave. There is more of everything and sometimes we get supper. We managed to get some bread & Butter and make toast Thursday night which went down well with a cup of coffee. We finished up the small cakes which I brought back but the big one, I expect we shall have a bit tonight about eight or nine.\nWe went to see a concert last night but the concert party didn;t turn up so they showed us a German Film. It was interesting to see what a german film was like and I understood the story of it more or less. I didn’t think it was much of a fi;m as it was all in the same place, all I saw was 2 houses at the bottom of some mountains.\nWe had a Batalion Drill parade this morning and during the parade one chap pulled his trigger and had a bullet in his rifle which narrowly missed the chap in front. Ofcourse he was immediatly put under close arrest as it is a court marshal offence. I expect the platoon commander will also get it in the neck for not inspecting the arms beforehand and also he was on guard last night (hence the round in his rifle) so I expect the guard commander will loose his stripes as it is his duty to inspect the guards’ arms when dismounting.\nI’m afraid that is all the news for now darling. I hope you get this just right for christmas and you have a wonderful time. Next year I expect we shall be together for xmas darling when we can realy go mad.\nGoodnight, my darling\nYour Ever Loving Husband\nBern\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nPte Shepherd B\nSignal Ptn\n1st Bn R. Norfolks\nB.A.O.R.\n\nDarling Wife\nJust a few lines dear as I’ve little else to do. Most of the boys have gone to Brittania Bar as there is a dance there tonight but as there are no eats I didn’t think it worth while going.\nI am writing this in Buffys room as he has a gas jet in here and with that going its lovely.\nWe are having a dead cushy time now we are in the signal platoon. Since I came back I have been on the ‘jutebox’ (switchboard) twice and the remainder of the days I have done nothing at all except a drill parade on Saturday. What a life - In one sence its like a Lords, and in another its like a beggers.\nYesterday we saw the film \"Song to Remember\", a life story of Choppan (I believe thats spelt correctly). They played alot of his music in it and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I hope you saw it dear I bet you cried your eyes out if you did.\nYou will, I expect, notice a difference in my handwriting, that is because I now have a fountain pen. I got it for 10 cigarettes and its quite a good one. I have also got your grandfather an open razer, and from what I understand of razors its pretty good too. I think its one of the best by the look of it. I’ll give it to the next chap who goes on leave to send it to you, unless I get a ‘fit’ and send it off by post.\nI recieved a christmas card from Beryl & Vic today, the only address on it was my No, name, and Royal Norfolks. Some one had scrawled \"BAOR\" on the bottom, \"1st Bat\" was in another writing and \"Sig office\" in another. \nWhen I have finished this letter dear I’ll have a \"Brew up\" with the coffee I brought back (Its getting low, I shall soon have to start on the tea, tho’ I don’t quite know how we are going to make it as we’ve no tea pot but where there is tea there is a way!) I have a mate in the cookhouse who got me a couple of sausage rolls tonight and I have my cake so I’ll have a tea party on my own.\nWe have a marvelous tea tonight. We had cornish pasties and bakes beans - jam and mixed tinned fruit and custard. Goodness knows what happened. Anyway, the food is better alround now, and altho we still get some we still get some dehydrated potatoes, etc, we get more of most things, including bread which is a very important item.\nWhen you recieve this letter darling I expect christmas will be over as the mail as bound to be held up with the Xmas post rush. There sill be a bigger post than ever this year with the BLA out here. No one had much time for it last year as we were too busy. I hope you have a wonderful time, my darling, and wish that I could be there with you to enjoy it. It wont be any good without you dear. Maybe next year darling I shall be there in civies, then I shan’t have to sit and unsucessfully try and put into words what I feel, by just looking at each other we can tell. All I can think to write now darling is that I love you from the bottom of my heart and nothing could ever shift that Love\nGoodnight, My Darling\nYou Ever Loving Husband\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nPte Shepherd B\nSignal Ptn\n1st Bn Royal Norfolks\nBAOR\n\nMy Darling Wife\nThank you for the Christmas card and 2 letters dearest, Nos 3 and 4.\nThank you for getting a pipe dear I expect it caused you quite a bit of trouble getting one. I’m not fussy about the tobacco as I’ve not smoked a pipe for a considerable time and will have to find which I like best by trial. Before I used to have \"St Julien\" but I’m not particular, any well known brand will do if you can get any, please dear.\nYes dear I wrote to Claude soon after I arrived back and told him roughly what we did on leave. \nI’m certain darling that married life agrees with me and I shall never regret it. As for looking younger, I never did think I looked very old and if I start getting younger I shall go back to school again! Now I’m married, even when I’m away from you dearest, I have a feeling of joy in my heart which was not there before. I gave Sgt Carr that piece of our wedding cake dear and also a piece of the big cake to \"prove that you could cook. He said he would judge you by your cooking but as I havent seen him since I havent heard the verdict.\nI think I should be home for good by next Christmas too dear. This is my forth one away which is too long. I have no excitement for this years Xmas as I don’t suppose it will be anything exceptional. The dinner will be the best part of it which is generaly very good in the army.\nThe chap we saw in the ‘district’ when on leave came back the other day. He had his big pack half full of coffee beans. He is trying to get some spirits for Xmas for us.\nThere is no need for me to say how much I love you as you know how great it is, I could never put it into words dearest but I realise how great your love is for me dear by thinking of my love for you.\nI got stung for some work while I was writing this letter. We had to unload 3 tons of coke, the hardest I’ve worked for ages. I didn’t mind as it made a change and the colour Sgt gave us 20 fags each afterwards which will come in very handy.\nWe are going up to Brittania Bar this evening. There should have been a show on tonight but for some reason it was cancelled this afternoon. We had decided to go out so as there is no show we are off to the Bar and listen to the band. The Band in Brit. Bar has got quite a bit of English music now, they play dance music very well too.\nI must close now darling else the boys will be waiting for me.\nGoodnight darling\nYour Ever Loving Husband\nBern\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nL/c Shepherd B\nSignal Ptn\n1st Norfolks\nBAOR\n\nMy Darling Wife,\nThank you very much for your parcel darling. The pencil will be very handy to me as long as I can get some refills as we are not allowed to use ink for signal work as it runs if it gets wet and I’m always running out of pencils. You shouldn’t have sent the cigarettes darling as I know it is a job for you to get them. Thank you very much, tho sweetheart, I havent sent you anything dear but I have something on order which I hope the chap gets. I will either sent it to you or bring it home when I get demobbed.\nPlease excuse the pencil dear I’ve left my pen in the cadre room, I hope it will still be there in the morning.\nThe cadre was out on a wireless scheme this afternoon so of course I was out too. It was bitter cold but we kept walking fast so it wasn’t too bad. We;ve had more schemes this week than any other week and it has been the coldest week we’ve had! The moat is frozen thick now altho its patchy owing to it being running water I suppose. The sun was shining gloriously today but there was hardly any heat in it.\nLast night and Tonight we spent in the canteen. Derrick had a truck outside which he was to take back to the MT yard tonight, so he said he would first run me round to the canteen. Half way there it Konked out so we had to mess arround finding a truck to tow us to the yard. In the end they fetched Duffy out. He was very pleased. So I had to walk to the canteen after all.\nI’ve still got my cold on me but I don’t think its so bad. Mind you, it never was very much to speak of.\nI havent heard anything about my wallet darling so I have now given it up as lost. I’m terribly sorry dear all our honeymoon photos were it there and of when we were at canvey last. The only thing I didn’t have in there was the big photos of you dear and the big wedding ones.\nMy pencil has just run out of lead dear so I’ll have to finish off with a common wooden one.\nI can’t think of any thing else to write about now darling so I’m afraid this will be about all.\n47 group will soon flash on to demob dear when Xmas has gone. I don’t seem to have the dame interest in Xmas as I have other years. Let it go by and roll on to the day when I’m home with you dear. That will be better than all the Christmasses put together. \nGoodnight darling I love you with all my heart\nYour Ever Loving Husband\nBern\n xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n"

      "letter":"14232057\nPte Shepherd B\nSignal Ptn\n1st Bn R Norfolk\nBAOR\n\nMy Darling Wife\nThank you dearest, for letter no 5 which I recieved yesterday.\nI expect you are busy with the preparation for Xmas as it is getting so near. Ofcourse I was forgetting for the moment that by the time you receive this letter dear christmas will all be over. I felt as though I was speaking to you for the minute. Next December we shall be planning it together darling and what a time we shall have. 1946 will soon flash by, my dear, and then heaven for ever. Norman (the chap we met) is getting some spirits with the coffee he brought hack and we should get pretty merry on it as its really strong stuff. The stuff is quire good and genuine as his girl is getting it for him. He has had some of it before round her place. We shall go to church parade Xmas morning, have dinner at the ‘Bar’ then come back have the spirits with some beer and get realy merry. There is a running buffet from 5 till 6 at the ‘Bar’ instead of a set tea meal.\nWe had a laugh here yesterday. A Belgium girl wrote to one of our chaps in English and finished off with \"May god pickle you\". Appearantly she had looked up \"preserve\" in an English Belgium book and it had said Pickle.\nOf all things! They’ve got me on Batallion Guard on 28th Dec. It has shaken me dear to the ground. The companies usually do it but now and again H.Q. do it so they have put me on. Anyway it lets me off duty on Xmas day.\nWe went to Brit. Bar last night and listened to the band but there was hardly anyone in there except us. Just Duffy, Green and myself went. I’m not going out this evening as theres nothing on and the Bar gets boring. I shall be on duty tomorrow so I don’t suppose I shall be able to get off for the pictures - I’ve seen the film anyway.\nI’m afraid that is all the news for now darling. Time is going by sweetheart, and by the time we’ve got straightened out after xmas we can start planning my next leave. Goodnight, my darling, I Love you as deep as the ocean\nYour Ever Loving Husband\nBern\n"

We went to church in the town hall in the morning. Had dinner in Brittania Bar which comprised of Turkey, goose & beef, Baked & boiled potatoes, runner beans, christmas pudding, beer, apples & toffees. The German Band was in attendance with all the old tunes \"Tipparary\" etc. Afterwards we came back to the billet where we had a store of drink, 3 bottles of spirits and 30/40 bottles of the best German Beer which isn’t too bad. We had a singsong with myself on the piano untill I couldn’t see what note I was playing. We then went down the Bar t o tea and stayed there for the dance. We got back here at 12:30. Duffy was there just getting up from his bed where he had passed out just before tea.\nIn the new year for a month only I shall be a L/cpl. I am going on a course on the 6th Jan to the Brigade infantry school on a Corporals signal refresher course. They have to make me a L/cpl before I can go so I’m ‘made up’ for the duration of the course. When I return on the 2nd February I shall once again be a private. Don’t put L/cpl on your letters till I say so. \nI’m on BHQ guard on the 28th dear which I’m not looking forward to very much. Still, Duffy my mate is on with me.\nI will close now darling as I’m afraid my head wont stand much more, Give my Love to Mum & Rene.
